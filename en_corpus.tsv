If the ECM receives a engine speed signal from the camshaft position sensor (PHASE), it knows that the engine is rotating, and causes the pump to operate. If the engine speed signal is not received when the ignition switch is ON, the engine stalls. The ECM stops pump operation and prevents battery discharging, thereby improving safety. The ECM does not directly drive the fuel pump. It controls the ON/OFF fuel pump relay, which in turn controls the fuel pump. PBIB1569E UBS00LZT UBS00LZU"

UBS00LZG BBIA0569E PBIB1822E When the engine is running at medium speed, the ECM sends the ON signal to the VIAS control solenoid valve. This signal introduces the intake manifold vacuum into the power valve actuator and therefore closes the power valve. Under this condition, the effective intake manifold length is equivalent to the total length of passage A and passage B. This long intake manifold provides increased amount of intake air, which results in improved suction efficiency and higher torque. When engine is running at low or high speed, the ECM sends the OFF signal to the VIAS control solenoid valve and the power valve is opened. Under this condition, the effective intake manifold length is equivalent to the length of passage B. This shortened intake manifold length results in enhanced engine output due to reduced suction resistance under high speeds. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION Power Valve The power valve is installed in intake manifold collector and used to control the suction passage of the variable induction air control system. It is set in the fully closed or fully opened position by the power valve actuator operated by the vacuum stored in the surge tank. The vacuum in the surge tank is controlled by the VIAS control solenoid valve. VIAS Control Solenoid Valve The VIAS control solenoid valve cuts the intake manifold vacuum signal for power valve control. It responds to ON/OFF signals from the ECM. When the solenoid is OFF, the vacuum signal from the intake manifold is cut. When the ECM sends an ON signal the coil pulls the plunger downward and feeds the vacuum signal to the power valve actuator. CONSULT-II Reference Value in Data Monitor Mode Specification data are reference values. UBS00LZI 3. Turn VIAS control solenoid valve ON and OFF , and make sure that power valve actuator rod moves."

Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer to EI-9, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur).   If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer. After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise.  Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.  Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor) Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity.   Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance.  Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action. Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions. Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity. Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact. Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person. A noise that you may judge as acceptable may be very irritating to the customer.   Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature, may have a great effect on noise level.

"1 SGI231 EAS001G7 Observe the following precautions to ensure safe and proper servicing. These precautions are not described in each individual section. Precautions for Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER EAS001G8 C D E The Supplemental Restraint System such as AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER , used along with a front seat belt, helps to reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger for certain types of collision. This system includes seat belt switch inputs and dual stage front air bag modules. The SRS system uses the seat belt switches to determine the front air bag deployment, and may only deploy one front air bag, depending on the severity of a collision and whether the front occupants are belted or unbelted. Information necessary to service the system safely is included in the SRS and SB section of this Service Manual. WARNING: F To avoid rendering the SRS inoperative, which could increase the risk of personal injury or death in the event of a collision which would result in air bag inflation, all maintenance must be performed by an authorized NISSAN/INFINITI dealer.   Improper maintenance, including incorrect removal and installation of the SRS, can lead to personal injury caused by unintentional activation of the system. For removal of Spiral Cable and Air Bag Module, see the SRS section. Do not use electrical test equipment on any circuit related to the SRS unless instructed to in this Service Manual. SRS wiring harnesses can be identified by yellow and/or orange harnesses or harness connectors. General Precautions EAS001G9 Do not operate the engine for an extended period of time without   proper exhaust ventilation. Keep the work area well ventilated and free of any inflammable materials. Special care should be taken when handling any inflammable or poisonous materials, such as gasoline, refrigerant gas, etc. When working in a pit or other enclosed area, be sure to properly ventilate the area before working with hazardous materials. Do not smoke while working on the vehicle. Before jacking up the vehicle, apply wheel chocks or other tire blocks to the wheels to prevent the vehicle from moving. After jacking up the vehicle, support the vehicle weight with safety stands at the points designated for proper lifting before working on the vehicle. These operations should be done on a level surface. When removing a heavy component such as the engine or transaxle/transmission, be careful not to lose your balance and drop them. Also, do not allow them to strike adjacent parts, especially the brake tubes and master cylinder. SGI285 Before starting repairs which do not require battery power: Turn off ignition switch. Disconnect the negative battery terminal. If the battery terminals are disconnected, recorded memory of radio and each control unit is erased.  To prevent serious burns: Avoid contact with hot metal parts. Do not remove the radiator cap when the engine is hot. Dispose of drained oil or the solvent used for cleaning parts in an appropriate manner.   Do not attempt to top off the fuel tank after the fuel pump nozzle shuts off automatically. Continued refueling may cause fuel overflow, resulting in fuel spray and possibly a fire. Clean all disassembled parts in the designated liquid or solvent prior to inspection or assembly. SGI233 Replace oil seals, gaskets, packings, O-rings, locking washers, cotter pins, self-locking nuts, etc. with new ones. Replace inner and outer races of tapered roller bearings and needle bearings as a set. Arrange the disassembled parts in accordance with their assembled locations and sequence. Do not touch the terminals of electrical components which use microcomputers (such as ECM). Static electricity may damage internal electronic components. After disconnecting vacuum or air hoses, attach a tag to indicate the proper connection.   Use only the fluids and lubricants specified in this manual.    Use approved bonding agent, sealants or their equivalents when required. Use hand tools, power tools (disassembly only) and recommended special tools where specified for safe and efficient service repairs.   When repairing the fuel, oil, water, vacuum or exhaust systems, check all affected lines for leaks. SEF289H PBIC0190E Before servicing the vehicle: Protect fenders, upholstery and carpeting with appropriate covers. Take caution that keys, buckles or buttons do not scratch paint. SGI234 CAUTION: H I Do not use leaded gasoline. Using leaded gasoline will damage the three way catalyst. Do not use E-85 fuel (85% fuel ethanol, 15% unleaded gasoline) unless the vehicle is specifically designed for E-85 fuel (i.e. Flexible Fuel Vehicle-FFV models). Using a fuel other than that specified could adversely affect the emission control devices and systems, and could also affect the warranty coverage validity. VQ40DE MODELS J Use unleaded regular gasoline with an octane rating of at least 87 AKI (Anti-Knock Index) number (Research octane number 91). E-85 fuel (85% fuel ethanol, 15% unleaded gasoline) may only be used in vehicles specifically designed for E-85 fuel (i.e. Flexible Fuel Vehicles-FFV models). K For improved vehicle performance, NISSAN/INFINITI recommend the use of unleaded premium gasoline with an octane rating of at least 91 AKI number (Research octane number 96). L M CAUTION: Do not use leaded gasoline. Using leaded gasoline will damage the three way catalyst. Do not use E-85 fuel (85% fuel ethanol, 15% unleaded gasoline) unless the vehicle is specifically designed for E-85 fuel (i.e. Flexible Fuel Vehicle-FFV models). Using a fuel other than that specified could adversely affect the emission control devices and systems, and could also affect the warranty coverage validity. Precautions for Multiport Fuel Injection System or Engine Control System EAS001GC Before connecting or disconnecting any harness connector for the multiport fuel injection system or ECM: Turn ignition switch to OFF position. Disconnect negative battery terminal. Otherwise, there may be damage to ECM. Before disconnecting pressurized fuel line from fuel pump to injectors, be sure to release fuel pressure. Be careful not to jar components such as ECM and mass ai rflow sensor.   Precautions for Hoses HOSE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION To prevent damage to rubber hose, do not pry off rubber hose with tapered tool or screwdriver. SMA022D Precautions for Engine Oils EAS001GE Prolonged and repeated contact with used engine oil may cause skin cancer. Try to avoid direct skin contact with used oil. If skin contact is made, wash thoroughly with soap or hand cleaner as soon as possible. HEALTH PROTECTION PRECAUTIONS  Avoid prolonged and repeated contact with oils, particularly used engine oils.

"4 Reference Area The Reference Area of the wiring diagram contains references to additional electrical reference pages at the end of the manual. If connector numbers and titles are shown in the Reference Area of the wiring diagram, these connector symbols are not shown in the Connector Area. EAS001GO HOW TO PROBE CONNECTORS Connector damage and an intermittent connection can result from improperly probing of the connector during circuit checks. J The probe of a digital multimeter (DMM) may not correctly fit the connector cavity. To correctly probe the connector, follow the procedures below using a T pin. For the best contact grasp the T pin using an alligator clip. Probing from Harness Side  Standard type (not waterproof type) connector should be probed from harness side with T pin. If the connector has a rear cover such as a ECM connector, remove the rear cover before probing the terminal.   Do not probe waterproof connector from harness side. Damage to the seal between wire and connector may result. SERVICE INFORMATION FOR ELECTRICAL INCIDENT How to Check Terminal CONNECTOR AND TERMINAL PIN KIT Use the connector and terminal pin kits listed below when replacing connectors or terminals. The connector and terminal pin kits contain some of the most commonly used NISSAN/INFINITI connectors and terminals. For detailed connector and terminal pin replacement procedures, refer to the latest NISSAN/ INFINITI CONNECTOR AND TERMINAL PIN SERVICE MANUAL. Tool number (Kent-Moore No.) Tool name WAIA0005E SEL265V Probing from Terminal Side FEMALE TERMINAL There is a small notch above each female terminal. Probe each terminal with the T pin through the notch. Do not insert any object other than the same type male terminal into female terminal.   SGI841 3. While holding the wire of the male terminal, try to insert the male terminal into the female terminal. Do not force the male terminal into the female terminal with your hands. GI-26 Some connectors do not have a notch above each terminal. To probe each terminal, remove the connector retainer to make contact space for probing. SEL267V SEL266V How to Check Enlarged Contact Spring of Terminal  An enlarged contact spring of a terminal may create intermittent signals in the circuit. If the intermittent open circuit occurs, follow the procedure below to inspect for open wires and enlarged contact spring of female terminal. 1. Assemble a male terminal and approx. 10 cm (3.9 in) of wire. Use a male terminal which matches the female terminal. 2. Disconnect the suspected faulty connector and hold it terminal side up."
"5 WIRE SEAL INSPECTION The wire seal must be installed on the wire insertion area of a waterproof connector. Be sure that the seal is installed properly. Terminal Lock Inspection  Check for unlocked terminals by pulling wire at the end of connector. An unlocked terminal may create intermittent signals in the circuit. GI-27 RUBBER SEAL INSPECTION Most waterproof connectors are provided with a rubber seal between the male and female connectors. If the seal is missing, the waterproof performance may not meet specifications.   The rubber seal may come off when connectors are disconnected. Whenever connectors are reconnected, make sure the rubber seal is properly installed on either side of male or female connector. Waterproof Connector Inspection  If water enters the connector, it can short interior circuits. This may lead to intermittent problems. Check the following items to maintain the original waterproof characteristics. SEL275V INCIDENT SIMULATION TESTS  Introduction  Sometimes the symptom is not present when the vehicle is brought in for service. If possible, re-create the conditions present at the time of the incident. Doing so may help avoid a No Trouble Found Diagnosis. The following section illustrates ways to simulate the conditions/environment under which the owner experiences an electrical incident. The section is broken into the six following topics:  Vehicle vibration Heat sensitive   GI-28 EAS001GP SENSORS & RELAYS Gently apply a slight vibration to sensors and relays in the system you are inspecting. This test may indicate a loose or poorly mounted sensor or relay. ENGINE COMPARTMENT M There are several reasons a vehicle or engine vibration could cause an electrical complaint. Some of the things to check for are: Connectors not fully seated.   Wiring harness not long enough and is being stressed due to engine vibrations or rocking.   Wires laying across brackets or moving components.   Loose, dirty or corroded ground wires. Wires routed too close to hot components.   To inspect components under the hood, start by verifying the integrity of ground connections. (Refer to Ground Inspection described later.) First check that the system is properly grounded. Then check for loose connection by gently shaking the wiring or components as previously explained. Using the wiring diagrams inspect the wiring for continuity. SGI839 SGI843 An unclamped or loose harness can cause wiring to be pinched by seat components (such as slide guides) during vehicle vibration. If the wiring runs under seating areas, inspect wire routing for possible damage or pinching. Heat Sensitive  The customer s concern may occur during hot weather or after car has sat for a short time. In such cases you will want to check for a heat sensitive condition. To determine if an electrical component is heat sensitive, heat the component with a heat gun or equivalent. Do not heat components above 60 C (140 F). If incident occurs while heating the unit, either replace or properly insulate the component. Freezing  The customer may indicate the incident goes away after the car warms up (winter time). The cause could be related to water freezing somewhere in the wiring/electrical system. There are two methods to check for this. The first is to arrange for the owner to leave his car overnight. Make sure it will get cold enough to demonstrate his complaint. Leave the car parked outside overnight. In the morning, do a quick and thorough diagnosis of those electrical components which could be affected. The second method is to put the suspect component into a freezer long enough for any water to freeze. Reinstall the part into the car and check for the reoccurrence of the incident. If it occurs, repair or replace the component. Water Intrusion  The incident may occur only during high humidity or in rainy/snowy weather. In such cases the incident could be caused by water intrusion on an electrical part. This can be simulated by soaking the car or running it through a car wash. Do not spray water directly on any electrical components."
"6 SGI844 SGI845 Electrical Load  The incident may be electrical load sensitive. Perform diagnosis with all accessories (including A/C, rear window defogger, radio, fog lamps) turned on. Cold or Hot Start Up  On some occasions an electrical incident may occur only when the car is started cold, or it may occur when the car is restarted hot shortly after being turned off. In these cases you may have to keep the car overnight to make a proper diagnosis. NOTE: Refer to How to Check Terminal to probe or check terminal. Testing for Opens in the Circuit  Before you begin to diagnose and test the system, you should rough sketch a schematic of the system. This will help you to logically walk through the diagnosis process. Drawing the sketch will also reinforce your working knowledge of the system. CONTINUITY CHECK METHOD The continuity check is used to find an open in the circuit. The digital multimeter (DMM) set on the resistance function will indicate an open circuit as over limit (no beep tone or no ohms symbol). Make sure to always start with the DMM at the highest resistance level.  To help in understanding the diagnosis of open circuits, please refer to the previous schematic. Disconnect the battery negative cable. Start at one end of the circuit and work your way to the other end. (At the fuse block in this example) Connect one probe of the DMM to the fuse block terminal on the load side.     Connect the other probe to the fuse block (power) side of SW1. Little or no resistance will indicate that portion of the circuit has good continuity. If there were an open in the circuit, the DMM would indicate an over limit or infinite resistance condition. (point A)   Connect the probes between SW1 and the relay. Little or no resistance will indicate that portion of the circuit has good continuity. If there were an open in the circuit, the DMM would indicate an over limit or infinite resistance condition. (point B) Connect the probes between the relay and the solenoid. Little or no resistance will indicate that portion of the circuit has good continuity. If there were an open in the circuit, the DMM would indicate an over limit or infinite resistance condition. (point C) Any circuit can be diagnosed using the approach in the previous example. SGI846-A To simplify the discussion of shorts in the system, please refer to the following schematic. RESISTANCE CHECK METHOD  Disconnect the battery negative cable and remove the blown fuse. Disconnect all loads (SW1 open, relay disconnected and solenoid disconnected) powered through the fuse.   Connect one probe of the DMM to the load side of the fuse terminal. Connect the other probe to a known good ground. With SW1 open, check for continuity. continuity; short is between fuse terminal and SW1 (point A). no continuity; short is further down the circuit than SW1. Close SW1 and disconnect the relay. Put probes at the load side of fuse terminal and a known good ground. Then, check for continuity. continuity; short is between SW1 and the relay (point B). no continuity; short is further down the circuit than the relay. Close SW1 and jump the relay contacts with jumper wire. Put probes at the load side of fuse terminal and a known good ground. Then, check for continuity. continuity; short is between relay and solenoid (point C). no continuity; check solenoid, retrace steps. SGI847-A no voltage; short is further down the circuit than the relay. With SW1 closed, relay contacts jumped with fused jumper wire check for voltage. voltage; short is down the circuit of the relay or between the relay and the disconnected solenoid (point C). no voltage; retrace steps and check power to fuse block. Ground Inspection  Ground connections are very important to the proper operation of electrical and electronic circuits. Ground connections are often exposed to moisture, dirt and other corrosive elements. The corrosion (rust) can become an unwanted resistance. This unwanted resistance can change the way a circuit works. Electronically controlled circuits are very sensitive to proper grounding. A loose or corroded ground can drastically affect an electronically controlled circuit. A poor or corroded ground can easily affect the circuit. Even when the ground connection looks clean, there can be a thin film of rust on the surface. When inspecting a ground connection follow these rules: Remove the ground bolt or screw. Inspect all mating surfaces for tarnish, dirt, rust, etc. Clean as required to assure good contact.    Reinstall bolt or screw securely. Inspect for add-on accessories which may be interfering with the ground circuit. If several wires are crimped into one ground eyelet terminal, check for proper crimps. Make sure all of the wires are clean, securely fastened and providing a good ground path. If multiple wires are cased in one eyelet make sure no ground wires have excess wire insulation.     For detailed ground distribution information, refer to Ground Distribution in PG section. SGI853 MEASURING VOLTAGE DROP-STEP-BY-STEP The step-by-step method is most useful for isolating excessive drops in low voltage systems (such as those in Computer Controlled Systems ). Circuits in the Computer Controlled System operate on very low amperage. The (Computer Controlled) system operations can be adversely affected by any variation in resistance in the system. Such resistance variation may be caused by poor connection, improper installation, improper wire gauge or corrosion. The step by step voltage drop test can identify a component or wire with too much resistance. GI-34"

"1 SIIA0994E SQUEAK AND RATTLE TROUBLE DIAGNOSES Work Flow EIS0053G CUSTOMER INTERVIEW H Interview the customer if possible, to determine the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer to GW-9, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur). If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer. After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise.  Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.  Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor) Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity. Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance.  Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action. Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions. Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity. Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact. Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person. A noise that you may judge as acceptable may be very irritating to the customer.   Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature, may have a great effect on noise level.

Inform the customer that the vehicle should remain stationary until the urethane adhesive has completely cured (preferably 24 hours). Curing time varies with temperature and humidity. WARNING:  Keep heat and open flames away as primers and adhesive are flammable. The materials contained in the kit are harmful if swallowed, and may irritate skin and eyes. Avoid contact with the skin and eyes.   Use in an open, well ventilated location. Avoid breathing the vapors. They can be harmful if inhaled. If affected by vapor inhalation, immediately move to an area with fresh air. Driving the vehicle before the urethane adhesive has completely cured may affect the performance of the rear window in case of an accident. CAUTION:  Do not use an adhesive which is past its usable term. Shelf life of this product is limited to six months after the date of manufacture. Carefully adhere to the expiration or manufacture date printed on the box. Keep primers and adhesive in a cool, dry place. Ideally, they should be stored in a refrigerator. Do not leave primers or adhesive cartridge unattended with their caps open or off. The vehicle should not be driven for at least 24 hours or until the urethane adhesive has completely cured. Curing time varies depending on temperature and humidity. The curing time will increase under lower temperatures and lower humidities. Repairing Water Leaks for Rear Window Glass Leaks can be repaired without removing or reinstalling glass. If water is leaking between urethane adhesive material and body or glass, determine the extent of leakage. This can be done by applying water to the rear window area while pushing glass outward. To stop leak, apply primer (if necessary) and then urethane adhesive to the leak point.

"2 DESCRIPTION OF CAN DIAG SUPPORT MNTR SCREEN FOR ABS ACTUATOR AND ELEC-TRIC UNIT (CONTROL UNIT) ABS model CAN COMMUNICATION System Description UKS0030X CAN (Controller Area Network) is a serial communication line for real time application. It is an on-vehicle multiplex communication line with high data communication speed and excellent error detection ability. Many electronic control units are equipped onto a vehicle, and each control unit shares information and links with other control units during operation (not independent). In CAN communication, control units are connected with 2 communication lines (CAN H line, CAN L line) allowing a high rate of information transmission with less wiring. Each control unit transmits/receives data but selectively reads required data only.

"1 EKS00CLU I J Control of the headlamp system operation is dependent upon the position of the combination switch (lighting switch). When the lighting switch is placed in the 2ND position, the BCM (body control module) receives input requesting the headlamps (and tail lamps) illuminate. This input is communicated to the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room) across the CAN communication lines. The CPU (central processing unit) of the IPDM E/R controls the headlamp high and headlamp low relay coils. When energized, these relays direct power to the respective headlamps, which then illuminate.  OUTLINE Power is supplied at all times to headlamp high relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and   to headlamp low relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and      through 20A fuse (No. 53, located in the IPDM E/R) to CPU of the IPDM E/R, and through 50A fusible link (letter g, located in the fuse and fusible link box) to BCM terminal 70.     With the ignition switch in the ON or START position, power is supplied to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and   through 10A fuse [No. 1, located in the fuse block (J/B)] to BCM terminal 38.     Ground is supplied  to BCM terminal 67 through grounds M57, M61 and M79, and to IPDM E/R terminals 38 and 59 through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only). 4. Combination meter M24 Low Beam Operation With the lighting switch in 2ND position, the BCM receives input requesting the headlamps to illuminate. This input is communicated to the IPDM E/R across the CAN communication lines. The CPU of the IPDM E/R controls the headlamp low relay coil. When energized, this relay directs power through 15A fuse (No. 41, located in the IPDM E/R) through IPDM E/R terminal 54 to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 3, and through 15A fuse (No. 40, located in the IPDM E/R)  through IPDM E/R terminal 52 to front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 3. Ground is supplied to front combination lamp LH and RH (headlamp) terminal 2 through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only). With power and ground supplied, low beam headlamps illuminate. High Beam Operation/Flash-to-Pass Operation With the lighting switch in 2ND position and placed in HIGH or PASS position, the BCM receives input requesting the headlamp high beams to illuminate. This input is communicated to the IPDM E/R across the CAN communication lines. The CPU of the combination meter controls the ON/OFF status of the HIGH BEAM indicator. The CPU of the IPDM E/R controls the headlamp high relay coil. When energized, this relay directs power through 10A fuse (No. 34, located in the IPDM E/R)    through IPDM E/R terminal 56 to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 1, and    through 10A fuse (No. 35, located in the IPDM E/R) through IPDM E/R terminal 55 to front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 1. Ground is supplied  to front combination lamp LH and RH (headlamp) terminal 2 through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only).   With power and ground supplied, the high beam headlamps illuminate. BATTERY SAVER CONTROL When the combination switch (lighting switch) is in the 2ND position (ON), and the ignition switch is turned from ON or ACC to OFF, the battery saver control feature is activated. Under this condition, the headlamps remain illuminated for 5 minutes, unless the combination switch (lighting switch) position is changed. If the combination switch (lighting switch) position is changed, then the headlamps are turned off. AUTO LIGHT OPERATION Refer to LT-40, System Description for auto light operation.

LT-28 IPDM E/R E122, E123, E124 BCM M18, M20 (view with lower instrument panel LH removed) 7. Daytime light relay 1 E103 10. Combination meter M24 System Description EKS00CM7 Daytime light system turns on daytime light lamps while driving. Daytime light lamps are not turned on if engine is activated with parking brake on. Take off parking brake to turn on daytime light lamps. The lamps turn off when lighting switch is in the 2ND position or AUTO position (Headlamp is ON ) and when lighting switch is in the PASSING position. (Daytime light lamps are not turned off only by parking brake itself.) A parking brake signal and engine run or stop signal are sent to BCM (body control module) by CAN communication line. High Beam Operation/Flash-to-Pass Operation A B With the lighting switch in 2ND position and placed in HIGH or PASS position, the BCM receives input requesting the headlamp high beams to illuminate. This input is communicated to the IPDM E/R across the CAN communication lines. The CPU of the combination meter controls the ON/OFF status of the HIGH BEAM indicator. The CPU of the IPDM E/R controls the headlamp high relay coil. When energized, this relay directs power through 10A fuse (No. 34, located in the IPDM E/R)    through IPDM E/R terminal 56 to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 1, and through 10A fuse (No. 35, located in the IPDM E/R) through IPDM E/R terminal 55 to front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 1. Ground is supplied   to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 2, and to daytime light relay 1 terminal 4, and      to daytime light relay 2 terminal 1 through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only). When the CPU of the IPDM E/R energizes the headlamp high relay, it de-energizes daytime relay 1. When deenergized, this relay supplies ground  to front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 2 through daytime light relay 1 terminal 3. With power and ground supplied, the high beam headlamps illuminate. DAYTIME LIGHT OPERATION With the engine running, the lighting switch in the OFF or 1ST position and parking brake released, the IPDM E/R receives input requesting the daytime lights illuminate. This input is communicated across the CAN communication lines. The CPU of the IPDM E/R controls daytime light relay 1 which supplies ground to daytime light relay 1 terminal 1   through IPDM E/R terminal 44.   When energized, daytime light relay 1 directs power  through daytime light relay 1 terminal 3 through front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 2 through front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 1 through IPDM E/R terminal 55 through 10A fuse (No. 35, located in the IPDM E/R) through 10A fuse (No. 34, located in the IPDM E/R) through IPDM E/R terminal 56 to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 1.   Ground is supplied to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 2    through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only). With power and ground supplied, the daytime lights illuminate. The high beam headlamps are now wired in series and illuminate at a reduced intensity. COMBINATION SWITCH READING FUNCTION Refer to BCS-3, COMBINATION SWITCH READING FUNCTION .

EKS00CMN I J Control of the fog lamps is dependent upon the position of the combination switch (lighting switch). The lighting switch must be in the 2ND position or AUTO position (LOW beam is ON) for front fog lamp operation. When the lighting switch is placed in the fog lamp position, the BCM (body control module) receives input signal requesting the fog lamps to illuminate. When the headlamps are illuminated, this input signal is communicated to the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room) across the CAN communication lines. The CPU (central processing unit) of the IPDM E/R controls the front fog lamp relay coil. When activated, this relay directs power to the front fog lamps. OUTLINE Power is supplied at all times  to front fog lamp relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and through 20A fuse (No. 53, located in the IPDM E/R) to CPU of the IPDM E/R, and through 50A fusible link (letter g, located in the fuse and fusible link box) to BCM terminal 70. When the ignition switch is in ON or START position, power is supplied to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and through 10A fuse [No. 1, located in the fuse block (J/B)] to BCM terminal 38. Ground is supplied to BCM terminal 67 through grounds M57, M61 and M79, and to IPDM E/R terminals 38 and 59 through grounds E9, E15 and E24. FOG LAMP OPERATION The fog lamp switch is built into the combination switch. The lighting switch must be in the 2ND position or AUTO position (LOW beam is ON) and the fog lamp switch must be ON for fog lamp operation. With the fog lamp switch in the ON position, the CPU of the IPDM E/R grounds the coil side of the fog lamp relay.

WKIA3782E PFP:26550 EKS00BR6 EKS00CN6 Control of the parking, license plate, and tail lamp operation is dependent upon the position of the lighting switch (combination switch). When the lighting switch is placed in the 1ST position, the BCM (body control module) receives input signal requesting the parking, license plate, side marker and tail lamps to illuminate. This input signal is communicated to the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room) across the CAN communication lines. The CPU (central processing unit) of the IPDM E/R controls the tail lamp relay coil. This relay, when energized, directs power to the parking, license plate and tail lamps, which then illuminate.  Power is supplied at all times to tail lamp relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and    through 20A fuse (No. 53, located in the IPDM E/R) to CPU of the IPDM E/R, and to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and through 50A fusible link (letter g, located in the fuse and fusible link box) to BCM terminal 70. With the ignition switch in the ON or START position, power is supplied to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and through 10A fuse [No. 1, located in the fuse block (J/B)] to BCM terminal 38. Ground is supplied  to BCM terminal 67 through grounds M57, M61 and M79, and to IPDM E/R terminals 38 and 59 through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only). OPERATION BY LIGHTING SWITCH With the lighting switch in the 1ST or 2ND position (or if the auto light system is activated), the BCM receives input signal requesting the parking, license plate, side marker and tail lamps to illuminate. This input signal is communicated to the IPDM E/R across the CAN communication lines. The CPU of the IPDM E/R controls the tail lamp relay coil, which when energized, directs power through 10A fuse (No. 37, located in the IPDM E/R)   M18, M20 (view with lower instrument panel LH removed) through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only). With power and ground supplied, the parking, side marker, license plate and tail lamps illuminate. COMBINATION SWITCH READING FUNCTION Refer to BCS-3, COMBINATION SWITCH READING FUNCTION .

"1 Precautions for Refrigerant Connection EJS003OG A new type refrigerant connection has been introduced to all refrigerant lines except the following locations. Expansion valve to cooling unit   Evaporator pipes to evaporator (inside cooling unit)   Refrigerant pressure sensor   FEATURES OF NEW TYPE REFRIGERANT CONNECTION The O-ring has been relocated. It has also been provided with a groove for proper installation. This reduces the possibility of the O-ring being caught in, or damaged by, the mating part. The sealing direction of the O-ring is now set vertically in relation to the contacting surface of the mating part to improve sealing characteristics.   The reaction force of the O-ring will not occur in the direction that causes the joint to pull out, thereby facilitating piping connections. SHA815E O-RING AND REFRIGERANT CONNECTION A/C Compressor and Condenser 2. Clip 5. Condenser 8. Low-pressure flexible A/C hose 11. Expansion valve *: Always check with the Parts Department for the latest parts information. WARNING: Make sure all refrigerant is discharged into the recycling equipment and the pressure in the system is less than atmospheric pressure. Then gradually loosen the discharge side hose fitting and remove it. CAUTION: When replacing or cleaning refrigerant cycle components, observe the following. When the compressor is removed, store it in the same position as it is when mounted on the car. Failure to do so will cause oil to enter the low pressure chamber. When connecting tubes, always use a torque wrench and a back-up wrench.   After disconnecting tubes, immediately plug all openings to prevent entry of dirt and moisture. When installing an air conditioner in the vehicle, connect the pipes as the final stage of the operation. Do not remove the seal caps of pipes and other components until just before required for connection.     Allow components stored in cool areas to warm to working area temperature before removing seal caps. This prevents condensation from forming inside A/C components. Thoroughly remove moisture from the refrigeration system before charging the refrigerant. Always replace used O-rings. When connecting tube, apply oil to circle of the O-rings shown in illustration. Be careful not to apply oil to threaded portion. Oil name: Genuine NISSAN A/C System Oil Type R or equivalent. O-ring must be closely attached to dented portion of tube. When replacing the O-ring, be careful not to damage O-ring and tube. Connect tube until you hear it click, then tighten the nut or bolt by hand until snug. Make sure that the O-ring is installed to tube correctly. 1. High-pressure service valve 4. Refrigerant pressure sensor 7. High-pressure flexible A/C hose 10. Low-pressure A/C pipe CAUTION: The new and former refrigerant connections use different O-ring configurations. Do not confuse Orings since they are not interchangeable. If a wrong O-ring is installed, refrigerant will leak at or around the connection. O-Ring Part Numbers and Specifications Connec- tion type After connecting line, conduct leak test and make sure that there is no leakage from connections. When the refrigerant leaking point is found, disconnect that line and replace the O-ring. Then tighten connections of seal seat to the specified torque. RHA861F Precautions for Servicing Compressor EJS003OH Plug all openings to prevent moisture and foreign matter from entering. When the compressor is removed, store it in the same position as it is when mounted on the car.     When replacing or repairing compressor, follow Maintenance of Oil Quantity in Compressor exactly. Refer to MTC-19, Maintenance of Oil Quantity in Compressor .   Keep friction surfaces between clutch and pulley clean. If the surface is contaminated with oil, wipe it off by using a clean waste cloth moistened with thinner. After compressor service operation, turn the compressor shaft by hand more than 5 turns in both directions. This will equally distribute oil inside the compressor. After the compressor is installed, let the engine idle and operate the compressor for 1 hour.  After replacing the compressor magnet clutch, apply voltage to the new one and check for normal operation. Refer to MTC-104, Removal and Installation for Compressor Clutch . Precautions for Service Equipment RECOVERY/RECYCLING EQUIPMENT EJS003OI Follow the manufacturer s instructions for machine operation and machine maintenance. Never introduce any refrigerant other than that specified into the machine. ELECTRONIC LEAK DETECTOR Follow the manufacturer s instructions for tester operation and tester maintenance. VACUUM PUMP The oil contained inside the vacuum pump is not compatible with the specified oil for HFC-134a (R-134a) A/C systems. The vent side of the vacuum pump is exposed to atmospheric pressure so the vacuum pump oil may migrate out of the pump into the service hose. This is possible when the pump is switched off after evacuation (vacuuming) and hose is connected to it. To prevent this migration, use a manual valve situated near the hose-to-pump connection, as follows. Usually vacuum pumps have a manual isolator valve as part of the pump. Close this valve to isolate the service hose from the pump.   For pumps without an isolator, use a hose equipped with a manual shut-off valve near the pump end. Close the valve to isolate the hose from the pump. If the hose has an automatic shut off valve, disconnect the hose from the pump: as long as the hose is connected, the valve is open and lubricating oil may migrate. Some one-way valves open when vacuum is applied and close under a no vacuum condition. Such valves may restrict the pump s ability to pull a deep vacuum and are not recommended. SHA533D RHA270D MANIFOLD GAUGE SET Be certain that the gauge face indicates HFC-134a (R-134a). Make sure the gauge set has 1/2 -16 ACME threaded connections for service hoses. Confirm the set has been used only with refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a) along with specified oil. RHA272D SERVICE HOSES Be certain that the service hoses display the markings described (colored hose with black stripe). All hoses must include positive shutoff devices (either manual or automatic) near the end of the hoses opposite the manifold gauge."
"2 REFRIGERANT WEIGHT SCALE Verify that no refrigerant other than HFC134a (R-134a) and specified oils have been used with the scale. If the scale controls refrigeran tflow electronically, the hose fitting must be 1/2 -16 ACME. CHARGING CYLINDER I Using a charging cylinder is not recommended. Refrigerant may be vented into air from cylinder s top valve when filling the cylinder with refrigerant. Also, the accuracy of the cylinder is generally less than that of an electronic scale or of quality recycle/recharge equipment. RHA273D MTC-12 Commercial Service Tools Tool name (J-41810-NI) Refrigerant identifier equipment (R- 134a) REFRIGERANT FLOW The refrigerant flows in the standard pattern. Refrigerant flows through the compressor, condenser, liquid tank, expansion valve, evaporator, and back to the compressor. The refrigerant evaporation through the evaporator coil is controlled by an externally equalized expansion valve, located inside the evaporator case. FREEZE PROTECTION The compressor cycles on and off to maintain the evaporator temperature within a specified range. When the evaporator coil temperature falls below a specified point, the intake sensor interrupts the compressor operation. When the evaporator coil temperature rises above the specification, the intake sensor allows compressor operation. Refrigerant System Protection REFRIGERANT PRESSURE SENSOR EJS003OO The refrigerant system is protected against excessively high-or low-pressures by the refrigerant pressure sensor, located on the condenser. If the system pressure rises above or falls below the specifications, the refrigerant pressure sensor detects the pressure inside the refrigerant line and sends a voltage signal to the ECM. The ECM de-energizes the A/C relay to disengage the magnetic compressor clutch when pressure on the high pressure side detected by refrigerant pressure sensor is over about 2,746 kPa (28 kg/cm$^{2}$, 398 psi), or below about 120 kPa (1.22 kg/cm$^{2}$, 17.4 psi). PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE The refrigerant system is also protected by a pressure relief valve, located in the rear head of the compressor. When the pressure of refrigerant in the system increases to an abnormal level [more than 2,990 kPa (30.5 kg/ cm$^{2}$, 433.6 psi)], the release port on the pressure relief valve automatically opens and releases refrigerant into the atmosphere.

Drain the oil from the old (removed) compressor into a graduated container and recover the amount of oil drained. 6. Drain the oil from the new compressor into a separate, clean container. 7. Measure an amount of new oil installed equal to amount drained from old compressor. Add this oil to new compressor through the suction port opening. 8. Measure an amount of new oil equal to the amount recovered during discharging. Add this oil to new compressor through the suction port opening. 9. If the liquid tank also needs to be replaced, add an additional 5 m (0.2 US fl oz, 0.2 Imp fl oz) of oil at this time. When the A/C switch is pressed, or the mode switch is turned to the defroster position, the front air control outputs a compressor ON signal to BCM. The BCM then sends a compressor ON signal to ECM, via CAN communication line. AIR CONDITIONER CONTROL Description EJS003R2 The front air control provides regulation of the vehicle s interior temperature. The system is based on the position of the front air controls temperature switch selected by the driver. This is done by utilizing a microcomputer, also referred to as the front air control, which receives input signals from the following two sensors: Intake sensor  PBR (position balanced resistor) The front air control uses these signals (including the set position of the temperature switch) to control:  Outlet air volume Air temperature Air distribution Operation EJS003R3 AIR MIX DOOR CONTROL The air mix door is controlled so that in-vehicle temperature changed based on the position of the temperature switch. BLOWER SPEED CONTROL Blower speed is controlled based on front blower switch settings. When blower switch is turned, the blower motor starts and increases air flow volume each time the blower switch is turned counterclockwise, and decreases air flow volume each time the blower switch is turned counterclockwise. INTAKE DOORS CONTROL The intake doors are controlled by the recirculation switch setting, and the mode (defroster) switch setting. MODE DOOR CONTROL The mode door is controlled by the position of the mode dial. DEFROSTER DOOR CONTROL The defroster door is controlled by the mode dial set to defroster. MAGNET CLUTCH CONTROL Description of Control System The control system consists of input sensors, switches, the front air control (microcomputer) and outputs. The relationship of these components is shown in the figure below: WJIA1495E Front air control Temperature control dial Rear window defogger switch (if equipped) TEMPERATURE CONTROL DIAL (TEMPERATURE CONTROL) Blower control dial Recirculation switch Increases or decreases the set temperature. RECIRCULATION () SWITCH When REC switch is ON, REC switch indicator turns ON, and air inlet is set to REC. When REC switch is turned OFF, air inlet is set to fresh. REC mode can be re-entered by pressing REC switch again. REC switch is not operated when DEF switch is turned ON, at the D/F position, or at the floor position. DEFROSTER SWITCH Positions the air outlet doors to the defrost position. Also positions the intake doors to the outside air position and compressor (with A/C) is enabled. REAR WINDOW DEFOGGER SWITCH (IF EQUIPPED) When switch is ON, rear window is defogged. OFF SWITCH (BLOWER SPEED SET TO 0) The compressor and blower are OFF. A/C SWITCH (IF EQUIPPED) The compressor is ON or OFF. MODE DIAL Controls the air discharge outlets. BLOWER CONTROL DIAL Manually controls the four blower speeds, and turns blower off and on."

"6 Air mix door motor   PBR (built into air mix door motor) Intake sensor (with A/C) System Operation The front air control receives data from the temperature selected by the driver. The front air control then applies a voltage to one circuit of the air mix door motor, while ground is applied to the other circuit, causing the air mix door motor to rotate. The direction of rotation is determined by which circuit has voltage applied to it, and which one has ground applied to it. The front air control monitors the air mix door positions by measuring the voltage signal on the PBR circuits of each door. Air Mix Door Control Specification COMPONENT DESCRIPTION Air Mix Door Motor  WJIA1316E The air mix door motor is attached to the front heater & cooling unit assembly. This motor rotates so that the air mix door is opened or closed to a position set by the front air control. Motor rotation is then conveyed through a shaft and the air mix door position is then fed back to the front air control by the PBR built into the air mix door motor. WJIA1636E 2.

Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer to RF-8, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur).   If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer.  After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise. Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.  Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor) Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity. Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance. Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action.  Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions. Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity. Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact. Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person. A noise that you may judge as acceptable may be very irritating to the customer.   Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature, may have a great effect on noise level.

The voltage output is controlled by the IC regulator. Power is supplied at all times to generator terminal 3 through: 15A fuse (No. 30, located in the fuse and fusible link box).   C D Terminal 1 supplies power to charge the battery and operate the vehicle s electrical system. Output voltage is controlled by the IC regulator at terminal 3 detecting the input voltage. A pulse width modulated (PWM) signal is sent from terminal 37 of the IPDM E/R to terminal 4 of the generator. The ECM determines the duty cycle of the power generation variable voltage control system. The charging circuit is protected by the 140A fusible link [No. a, located in the fusible link box (battery)]. The generator is grounded through the engine. With the ignition switch in the ON or START position, power is supplied: through 10A fuse [No. 14, located in the fuse block (J/B)]   to combination meter terminal 16 for the charge warning lamp.   F G Ground is supplied to terminal 2 of the combination meter through terminal 2 of the generator. With power and ground supplied, the charge warning lamp will illuminate. When the generator is providing sufficient voltage with the engine running, the ground is opened and the charge warning lamp will go off. If the charge warning lamp illuminates with the engine running, a fault is indicated. The IC regulator warning function activates to illuminate CHARGE warning lamp, if any of the following symptoms occur while generator is operating:  Excessive voltage is produced. No voltage is produced. POWER GENERATION VARIABLE VOLTAGE CONTROL SYSTEM NOTE: Power generation variable voltage control system has been adopted. By varying the voltage to the generator, engine load due to power generation of the generator is reduced and fuel consumption is decreased. Operation The battery current sensor detects the charging/discharging current of the battery. ECM judges the battery condition based on this signal.   ECM judges whether to control voltage according to the battery condition. ECM calculates the target power generation voltage according to the battery condition and sends the calculated value, through CAN lines, as the power generation command value to IPDM E/R. IPDM E/R converts the received power generation command value into the power generation command signal (PWM signal) and sends it to the IC regulator.  The IC regulator performs final control over the power generation voltage. PKIB4908E BBIA0630E When there is no power generation command signal, the generator performs the normal power generation according to the characteristic of the IC regulator. NOTE: When any malfunction is detected in the power generation variable voltage control system, power generation is performed according to the characteristic of the IC regulator in the generator. Component Battery current sensor is installed to the negative battery cable and it detects the charging/discharging current of the battery and sends the voltage signal to ECM according to the current value.

Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer to SE-8, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur).   If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer.  After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise. Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.  Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor) Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity. Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance. Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action. Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions.  Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity. Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact. Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person.

"1 The air bag deploys if the air bag diagnosis sensor unit is activated while the ignition switch is in the ON or START position. The collision modes for which supplemental restraint systems are activated are different among the SRS systems. For example, the driver air bag module, front passenger air bag module and front seat belt pre-tensioners are activated in a frontal collision but not in a side collision. SRS configurations for some collision modes are as follows: SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) SRS Configuration WHIA0041E Occupant Classification System (OCS)  EHS001SB The occupant classification system (OCS) identifies different size occupants, out of position occupants, and detects if child seat is present in the front passenger seat. The OCS receives inputs from the occupant classification sensor (located inside the passenger seat cushion assembly) and belt tension sensor (part of the passenger front seat belt assembly and located at the belt anchor location). Depending on classification of the passenger, the OCS sends a signal to the air bag diagnosis sensor unit. The air bag diagnosis sensor unit uses this signal and the seat belt buckle switch RH signal to determine deployment or non deployment of the passenger front air bag in the event of a collision. Depending on the signals received, the air bag diagnosis sensor unit can disable the passenger front air bag completely. NOTE: In case of customer concern, CONSULT-II can be used to confirm the passenger air bag status (readiness). SRS-6 Front Seat Belt Pre-tensioner with Load Limiter The seat belt pre-tensioner system with load limiter is installed for both the driver s seat and the front passenger s seat. It operates simultaneously with the SRS air bag system in the event of a frontal collision with an impact exceeding a specified level. When the frontal collision with an impact exceeding a specified level occurs, seat belt slack resulting from clothing or other factors is immediately taken up by the pre-tensioner. Vehicle passengers are securely restrained. When passengers in a vehicle are thrown forward in a collision and the restraining force of the seat belt exceeds a specified level, the load limiter permits the specified extension of the seat belt by the twisting of the ELR shaft, and a relaxation of the chest-area seat belt web tension while maintaining force.

AT-30 SCIA1519E TCM Function The function of the TCM is to:  Receive input signals sent from various switches and sensors.  Determine required line pressure, shifting point, lock-up operation, and engine brake operation.  Send required output signals to the respective solenoids. CONTROL SYSTEM OUTLINE  The automatic transmission senses vehicle operating conditions through various sensors or signals. It always controls the optimum shift position and reduces shifting and lock-up shocks. AT-31"
"5 SCIA6495E *1: Spare for vehicle speed sensor A/T (revolution sensor) *2: Spare for accelerator pedal position signal *3: If these input and output signals are different, the TCM triggers the fail-safe function. *4: Used as a condition for starting self-diagnosis; if self-diagnosis are not started, it is judged that there is some kind of error *5: Input by CAN communications *6: Output by CAN communications AT-32 Back-up Control (Engine Brake) When the select operation is performed during driving and the transmission is shifted down, the line pressure is set according to the vehicle speed. Line Pressure Control UCS0041R  When an input torque signal equivalent to the engine drive force is sent from the ECM to the TCM, the TCM controls the line pressure solenoid.  This line pressure solenoid controls the pressure regulator valve as the signal pressure and adjusts the pressure of the operating oil discharged from the oil pump to the line pressure most appropriate to the driving state. PCIA0007E LINE PRESSURE CONTROL IS BASED ON THE TCM LINE PRESSURE CHARACTERISTIC PATTERN  G The TCM has stored in memory a number of patterns for the optimum line pressure characteristic for the driving state.  In order to obtain the most appropriate line pressure characteristic to meet the current driving state, the TCM controls the line pressure solenoid current value and thus controls the line pressure. Normal Control Each clutch is adjusted to the necessary pressure to match the engine drive force. PCIA0008E SHIFT CHANGE  The clutch is controlled with the optimum timing and oil pressure by the engine speed, engine torque information, etc. AT-34 During Shift Change The necessary and adequate line pressure for shift change is set. For this reason, line pressure pattern setting corresponds to input torque and gearshift selection. Also, line pressure characteristic is set according to engine speed, during engine brake operation. PCIA0012E PCIA0011E UCS0041S Shift Control The clutch pressure control solenoid is controlled by the signals from the switches and sensors. Thus, the clutch pressure is adjusted to be appropriate to the engine load state and vehicle driving state. It becomes possible to finely control the clutch hydraulic pressure with high precision and a smoother shift change characteristic is attained. At Low Fluid Temperature When the A/T fluid temperature drops below the prescribed temperature, in order to speed up the action of each friction element, the line pressure is set higher than the normal line pressure characteristic. Lock-up Released   In the lock-up released state, the torque converter clutch control valve is set into the unlocked state by the torque converter clutch solenoid and the lock-up apply pressure is drained. In this way, the torque converter clutch piston is not coupled."
"6 TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH CONTROL VALVE CONTROL Lock-up Control System Diagram PCIA0013E *1: Full phase real-time feedback control monitors movement of gear ratio at gear change, and controls oil pressure at real-time to achieve the best gear ratio. Lock-up Control UCS0041T I The torque converter clutch piston in the torque converter is engaged to eliminate torque converter slip to increase power transmission efficiency. The torque converter clutch control valve operation is controlled by the torque converter clutch solenoid valve, which is controlled by a signal from TCM, and the torque converter clutch control valve engages or releases the torque converter clutch piston. Lock-up Operation Condition Table SCIA1520E  The operation of the low coast brake solenoid switches the low coast brake switching valve and controls the coupling and releasing of the low coast brake. The low coast brake reducing valve controls the low coast brake coupling force. AT-36 Lock-up Applied  In the lock-up applied state, the torque converter clutch control valve is set into the locked state by the torque converter clutch solenoid and lock-up apply pressure is generated. In this way, the torque converter clutch piston is pressed and coupled. SMOOTH LOCK-UP CONTROL  When shifting from the lock-up released state to the lock-up applied state, the current output to the torque converter clutch solenoid is controlled with the TCM. In this way, when shifting to the lock-up applied state, the torque converter clutch is temporarily set to the half-clutched state to reduce the shock. Half-clutched State  The current output from the TCM to the torque converter clutch solenoid is varied to gradually increase the torque converter clutch solenoid pressure. In this way, the lock-up apply pressure gradually rises and while the torque converter clutch piston is put into half-clutched status, the torque converter clutch piston operating pressure is increased and the coupling is completed smoothly. Slip Lock-up Control  In the slip region, the torque converter clutch solenoid current is controlled with the TCM to put it into the half-clutched state. This absorbs the engine torque fluctuation and lock-up operates from low speed. This raises the fuel efficiency for 4th and 5th gears at both low speed and when the accelerator has a low degree of opening. Engine Brake Control UCS0041U The forward one-way clutch transmits the drive force from the engine to the rear wheels. But the reverse drive from the rear wheels is not transmitted to the engine because the one-way clutch is idling. Therefore, the low coast brake solenoid is operated to prevent the forward one-way clutch from idling and the engine brake is operated in the same manner as conventionally.   ON BOARD DIAGNOSTIC (OBD) SYSTEM Introduction UCS0041W The A/T system has two self-diagnostic systems. The first is the emission-related on board diagnostic system (OBD-II) performed by the TCM in combination AT with the ECM. The malfunction is indicated by the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) and is stored as a DTC in the ECM memory but not the TCM memory. The second is the TCM original self-diagnosis indicated by the A/T CHECK indicator lamp. The malfunction is stored in the TCM memory. The detected items are overlapped with OBD-II self-diagnostic items. For detail, refer to AT-89, SELF-DIAGNOSTIC RESULT MODE . OBD-II Function for A/T System UCS0041X E F The ECM provides emission-related on board diagnostic (OBD-II) functions for the A/T system. One function is to receive a signal from the TCM used with OBD-related parts of the A/T system. The signal is sent to the ECM when a malfunction occurs in the corresponding OBD-related part. The other function is to indicate a diagnostic result by means of the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) on the instrument panel. Sensors, switches and solenoid valves are used as sensing elements. The MIL automatically illuminates in One or Two Trip Detection Logic when a malfunction is sensed in relation to A/T system parts. G One or Two Trip Detection Logic of OBD-II UCS0041Y ONE TRIP DETECTION LOGIC If a malfunction is sensed during the first test drive, the MIL will illuminate and the malfunction will be stored in the ECM memory as a DTC. The TCM is not provided with such a memory function. TWO TRIP DETECTION LOGIC When a malfunction is sensed during the first test drive, it is stored in the ECM memory as a 1st trip DTC (diagnostic trouble code) or 1st trip freeze frame data. At this point, the MIL will not illuminate.-1st Trip If the same malfunction as that experienced during the first test drive is sensed during the second test drive, the MIL will illuminate.-2nd Trip The Trip in the One or Two Trip Detection Logic means a driving mode in which self-diagnosis is performed during vehicle operation. OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) HOW TO READ DTC AND 1ST TRIP DTC UCS0041Z K DTC and 1st trip DTC can be read by the following methods. (with CONSULT-II or GST) CONSULT-II or GST (Generic Scan Tool) Examples: P0705, P0720 etc. These DTC are prescribed by SAE J2012. (CONSULT-II also displays the malfunctioning component or system.) 1st trip DTC No. is the same as DTC No.    Output of the diagnostic trouble code indicates that the indicated circuit has a malfunction. However, in case of the Mode II and GST, they do not indicate whether the malfunction is still occurring or occurred in the past and returned to normal. CONSULT-II can identify them as shown below, therefore, CONSULT-II (if available) is recommended. A sample of CONSULT-II display for DTC and 1st trip DTC is shown on the next page. DTC or 1st trip DTC of a malfunction is displayed in SELF-DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS mode for ENGINE with CON-SULT-II. Time data indicates how many times the vehicle was driven after the last detection of a DTC. SAT016K SAT015K If a 1st trip DTC is stored in the ECM, the time data will be 1t . Freeze Frame Data and 1st Trip Freeze Frame Data The ECM has a memory function, which stores the driving condition such as fuel system status, calculated load value, engine coolant temperature, short term fuel trim, long term fuel trim, engine speed and vehicle speed at the moment the ECM detects a malfunction. Data which are stored in the ECM memory, along with the 1st trip DTC, are called 1st trip freeze frame data, and the data, stored together with the DTC data, are called freeze frame data and displayed on CONSULT-II or GST. The 1st trip freeze frame data can only be displayed on the CONSULT-II screen, not on the GST. For detail, refer to AT-39, ON BOARD DIAGNOSTIC (OBD) SYSTEM . Only one set of freeze frame data (either 1st trip freeze frame data of freeze frame data) can be stored in the ECM. 1st trip freeze frame data is stored in the ECM memory along with the 1st trip DTC. There is no priority for 1st trip freeze frame data and it is updated each time a different 1st trip DTC is detected. However, once freeze frame data (2nd trip detection/MIL on) is stored in the ECM memory, 1st trip freeze frame data is no longer stored. Remember, only one set of freeze frame data can be stored in the ECM. The ECM has the following priorities to update the data.  HOW TO ERASE DTC (WITH GST) 1. If the ignition switch stays ON after repair work, be sure to turn ignition switch OFF once. Wait at least 10 seconds and then turn it ON (engine stopped) again. 2. Select Mode 4 with the Generic Scan Tool (GST). For details refer to EC-129, Generic Scan Tool (GST) Function (QR) or EC-738, Generic Scan Tool (GST) Function (VQ).

"7  HOW TO ERASE DTC (NO TOOLS) 1. Disconnect battery for 24 hours. 2. Reconnect battery. Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) DESCRIPTION  The MIL is located on the instrument panel. 1. The MIL will light up when the ignition switch is turned ON without the engine running. This is a bulb check. .  If the MIL does not light up, refer to DI-31, WARNING LAMPS  2. When the engine is started, the MIL should go off. If the MIL remains on, the on board diagnostic system has detected an engine system malfunction. AT-42 UCS00420 SEF217U It is much more difficult to diagnose a error that occurs intermittently rather than continuously. Most intermittent errors are caused by poor electric connections or improper wiring. In this case, careful checking of suspected circuits may help prevent the replacement of good parts. A visual check only may not find the cause of the errors. A road test with CONSULT-II (or GST) or a circuit tester connected should be performed. Follow the AT-46, WORK FLOW . How To Perform Trouble Diagnosis For Quick and Accurate Repair INTRODUCTION The TCM receives a signal from the vehicle speed sensor, accelerator pedal position sensor (throttle position sensor) or PNP switch and provides shift control or lock-up control via A/T solenoid valves. The TCM also communicates with the ECM by means of a signal sent from sensing elements used with the OBD-related parts of the A/T system for malfunction-diagnostic purposes. The TCM is capable of diagnosing malfunctioning parts while the ECM can store malfunctions in its memory. Input and output signals must always be correct and stable in the operation of the A/T system. The A/T system must be in good operating condition and be free of valve seizure, solenoid valve malfunc- tion, etc. *1. AT-47 *2. AT-47 *3. AT-43 *4. AT-52 *5. AT-52, AT-53 *6. AT-55 *7. AT-87 *8.

"1 EIS0050E Description Locating the noise Commercial Service Tool (Kent-Moore No.) Tool name (J-39565) Engine ear LEL946A SQUEAK AND RATTLE TROUBLE DIAGNOSES Work Flow CUSTOMER INTERVIEW Interview the customer if possible, to determine the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer to BL-10, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs.  The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur).  If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer.   After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise.  Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.  Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor)   Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity. Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance.  Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action.  Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions.  Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity.  Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact.  Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person.

NATS antenna amplifier M21 (View with cluster lid A removed) NVIS(NISSAN VEHICLE IMMOBILIZER SYSTEM-NATS) Component Parts and Harness Connector Location NVIS (Nissan Vehicle Immobilizer System-NATS) has the following immobilizer functions:  Since only NVIS (NATS) ignition keys, whose IDs have been registered into the ECM and BCM, allow the engine to run, operation of a stolen vehicle without a NVIS (NATS) registered key is prevented by NVIS (NATS). NVIS (NATS) will immobilize the engine if someone tries to start it without the registered key of NVIS (NATS).  All of the originally supplied ignition key IDs have been NVIS (NATS) registered. If requested by the vehicle owner, a maximum of five key IDs can be registered into the NVIS (NATS) components.  The security indicator blinks when the ignition switch is in OFF or ACC position. NVIS (NATS) warns outsiders that the vehicle is equipped with the anti-theft system.  When NVIS (NATS) detects a malfunction, the security indicator lamp lights up while ignition key is in the ON position.  NVIS (NATS) trouble diagnoses, system initialization and additional registration of other NVIS (NATS) ignition key IDs must be carried out using CONSULT-II hardware and CONSULT-II NVIS (NATS) software. When NVIS (NATS) initialization has been completed, the ID of the inserted ignition key is automatically NVIS (NATS) registered. Then, if necessary, additional registration of other NVIS (NATS) ignition key IDs can be carried out. Regarding the procedures of NVIS (NATS) initialization and NVIS (NATS) ignition key ID registration, refer to CONSULT-II Operation Manual NATS-IVIS/NVIS.  When servicing a malfunction of the NVIS (NATS) (indicated by lighting up of Security Indicator Lamp) or registering another NVIS (NATS) ignition key ID, it may be necessary to re-register original key identification. Therefore, be sure to receive ALL KEYS from vehicle owner. System Composition EIS005VM The immobilizer function of the NVIS (NATS) consists of the following:  NATS ignition key  NATS antenna amp. located in the ignition key cylinder  Body control module (BCM)  Engine control module (ECM)  Security indicator NOTE: The communication between ECM and BCM uses the CAN communication system.

NISSAN Genuine Service Parts are also treated in the same manner. Therefore, it is recommended that GENUINE NISSAN PARTS or equivalent be used for panel replacement to maintain anti-corrosive performance built into the vehicle at the factory. CAUTION: Confine paint removal during welding operations to an absolute minimum. ANTI-CORROSIVE WAX A To improve corrosion resistance, anti-corrosive wax is applied inside the body sill and inside other closed sections. Accordingly, when replacing these parts, be sure to apply anti-corrosive wax to the appropriate areas of the new parts. Select an excellent anti-corrosive wax which will penetrate after application and has a long shelf life. UNDERCOATING The underside of the floor and wheelhouse are undercoated to prevent rust, vibration, noise and stone chipping. Therefore, when such a panel is replaced or repaired, apply undercoating to that part. Use an undercoating which is rust preventive, soundproof, vibration-proof, shock-resistant, adhesive, and durable. Precautions in Undercoating 1. Do not apply undercoating to any place unless specified (such as the areas above the muffler and three way catalyst which are subjected to heat). 2. Do not undercoat the exhaust pipe or other parts which become hot. 3. Do not undercoat rotating parts. 4. Apply bitumen wax after applying undercoating. LIIA1211E"

"21 LIIA2091E  Crew Cab Measurement points LOCATION OF PLASTIC PARTS LIIA2079E  When straightening body panels, use caution in pulling any HSS panel. Because HSS is very strong, pulling may cause deformation in adjacent portions of the body. In this case, increase the number of measuring points, and carefully pull the HSS panel. Precautions in Repairing High Strength Steel High strength steel is used for body panels in order to reduce vehicle weight. Accordingly, precautions in repairing automotive bodies made of high strength steel are described below: HIGH STRENGTH STEEL (HSS) USED IN NISSAN VEHICLES PIIA0117E  The spot weld on HSS panels is harder than that of an ordinary steel panel. Therefore, when cutting spot welds on a HSS panel, use a low speed high torque drill (1,000 to 1,200 rpm) to increase drill bit durability and facilitate the operation.  SP150 HSS panels with a tensile strength of 785 to 981 N/ mm$^{2}$ (80 to 100 kg/mm$^{2}$, 114 to 142 klb/sq in), used as reinforcement in the door guard beams, is too strong to repair. When these HSS parts are damaged, the outer panels also sustain substantial damage; therefore, the assembly parts must be replaced. 2. Precautions in spot welding HSS This work should be performed under standard working conditions. Always note the following when spot welding HSS:  The electrode tip diameter must be sized properly according to the metal thickness. PIIA0148E  The panel surfaces must fit flush to each other, leaving no gaps.  Follow the specifications for the proper welding pitch. Unit: mm (in) Minimum pitch ( (0.39) or over (0.47) or over (0.71) or over (0.79) or over (1.06) or over (1.22) or over Thickness (t) (0.024) (0.031) (0.039) (0.047) (0.063) (0.071) Foam Repair During factory body assembly, foam insulators are installed in certain body panels and locations around the vehicle. Use the following procedure(s) to replace any factory-installed foam insulators. URETHANE FOAM APPLICATIONS Use commercially available spray foam for sealant (foam material) repair of material used on vehicle. Read instructions on product for fill procedures. FILL PROCEDURES 1. Fill procedures after installation of service part. -Remove foam material remaining on vehicle side. -Clean area in which foam was removed. -Install service part. -Insert nozzle into hole near fill area and fill foam material or fill in enough to close gap with the service part.

"1 PRECAUTIONS Precautions for Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER EFS004YT C B The Supplemental Restraint System such as AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER , used along with a front seat belt, helps to reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger for certain types of collision. This system includes seat belt switch inputs and dual stage front air bag modules. The SRS system uses the seat belt switches to determine the front air bag deployment, and may only deploy one front air bag, depending on the severity of a collision and whether the front occupants are belted or unbelted. Information necessary to service the system safely is included in the SRS and SB section of this Service Manual. WARNING:  To avoid rendering the SRS inoperative, which could increase the risk of personal injury or death in the event of a collision which would result in air bag inflation, all maintenance must be performed by an authorized NISSAN/INFINITI dealer.  Improper maintenance, including incorrect removal and installation of the SRS, can lead to personal injury caused by unintentional activation of the system. For removal of Spiral Cable and Air Bag Module, see the SRS section.  Do not use electrical test equipment on any circuit related to the SRS unless instructed to in this Service Manual. SRS wiring harnesses can be identified by yellow and/or orange harnesses or harness connectors. Precautions for Brake System EFS004YU H Recommended fluid is Genuine NISSAN Super Heavy Duty Brake Fluid or equivalent. Refer to MA-11, RECOMMENDED FLUIDS AND LUBRICANTS .  Do not reuse drained brake fluid.  Be careful not to splash brake fluid on painted areas.  To clean or wash all parts of master cylinder, disc brake caliper and wheel cylinder, use clean brake fluid. Do not use mineral oils such as gasoline or kerosene. They will ruin rubber parts of the hydraulic system.  Use flare nut wrench when removing and installing brake tube.  Always check tightening torque when installing brake lines.  Before working, turn ignition switch to OFF and disconnect connectors for ABS actuator and electric unit (control unit) or battery terminals.  Burnish the brake contact surfaces after refinishing or replacing drums or rotors, after replacing pads or linings, or if a soft pedal occurs at very low mileage.

Hydraulic Circuit Diagram EFS0051Z SEF234G TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS How to Perform Trouble Diagnoses for Quick and Accurate Repair INTRODUCTION The ABS system has an electronic control unit to control major functions. The control unit accepts input signals from sensors and controls actuator operation. It is also important to check for air leaks in the booster or lines, lack of brake fluid, or other malfunctions in the brake system. It is much more difficult to diagnose a malfunction that occurs intermittently rather than continuously. Most intermittent conditions are caused by poor electrical connections or damaged wiring. In this case, careful checking of suspicious circuits may help prevent the replacement of good parts. A visual check only may not find the cause of the malfunction, so a road test should be performed. Before undertaking actual checks, take just a few minutes to talk with a customer who approaches with an ABS complaint. The customer is a very good source of information, especially for intermittent conditions. Through the talks with the customer, find out what symptoms are present and under what conditions they occur. Start your diagnosis by looking for conventional malfunctions first. This is one of the best ways to troubleshoot brake malfunctions on an ABS equipped vehicle. Also check related Service Bulletins for information.

"1 EC-14 PRECAUTIONS Precautions for Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER UBS00L2A The Supplemental Restraint System such as AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER , used along with a front seat belt, helps to reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger for certain types of collision. This system includes seat belt switch inputs and dual stage front air bag modules. The SRS system uses the seat belt switches to determine the front air bag deployment, and may only deploy one front air bag, depending on the severity of a collision and whether the front occupants are belted or unbelted. Information necessary to service the system safely is included in the SRS and SB section of this Service Manual. WARNING:  To avoid rendering the SRS inoperative, which could increase the risk of personal injury or death in the event of a collision which would result in air bag inflation, all maintenance must be performed by an authorized NISSAN/INFINITI dealer.  Improper maintenance, including incorrect removal and installation of the SRS, can lead to personal injury caused by unintentional activation of the system. For removal of Spiral Cable and Air Bag Module, see the SRS section.  Do not use electrical test equipment on any circuit related to the SRS unless instructed to in this Service Manual. SRS wiring harnesses can be identified by yellow and/or orange harnesses or harness connectors. On Board Diagnostic (OBD) System of Engine and A/T UBS00L2B The ECM has an on board diagnostic system. It will light up the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) to warn the driver of a malfunction causing emission deterioration. CAUTION:  Be sure to turn the ignition switch OFF and disconnect the negative battery cable before any repair or inspection work. The open/short circuit of related switches, sensors, solenoid valves, etc. will cause the MIL to light up.  Be sure to connect and lock the connectors securely after work. A loose (unlocked) connector will cause the MIL to light up due to the open circuit. (Be sure the connector is free from water, grease, dirt, bent terminals, etc.)  Certain systems and components, especially those related to OBD, may use a new style slidelocking type harness connector. For description and how to disconnect, refer to PG-83, HAR-NESS CONNECTOR .  Be sure to route and secure the harnesses properly after work. The interference of the harness with a bracket, etc. may cause the MIL to light up due to the short circuit.  Be sure to connect rubber tubes properly after work. A misconnected or disconnected rubber tube may cause the MIL to light up due to the malfunction of the EVAP system or fuel injection system, etc.  Be sure to erase the unnecessary malfunction information (repairs completed) from the ECM and TCM (Transmission control module) before returning the vehicle to the customer. Precaution UBS00L2C  Always use a 12 volt battery as power source.  Do not attempt to disconnect battery cables while engine is running.  Before connecting or disconnecting the ECM harness connector, turn ignition switch OFF and disconnect battery ground cable. Failure to do so may damage the ECM because battery voltage is applied to ECM even if ignition switch is turned OFF.  Before removing parts, turn ignition switch OFF and then disconnect battery ground cable.  When connecting or disconnecting pin connectors into or from ECM, take care not to damage pin terminals (bend or break). Make sure that there are not any bends or breaks on ECM pin terminal, when connecting pin connectors.  Securely connect ECM harness connectors. A poor connection can cause an extremely high (surge) voltage to develop in coil and condenser, thus resulting in damage to ICs.  Keep engine control system harness at least 10 cm (4 in) away from adjacent harness, to prevent engine control system malfunctions due to receiving external noise, degraded operation of ICs, etc.  Keep engine control system parts and harness dry. Before replacing ECM, perform ECM Terminals and Reference Value inspection and make sure ECM functions properly. Refer to EC-111, ECM Terminals and Reference Value  .  Handle mass air flow sensor carefully to avoid damage.  Do not clean mass air flow sensor with any type of detergent.  Do not disassemble electric throttle control actuator. Even a slight leak in the air intake system can cause serious incidents.  Do not shock or jar the camshaft position sensor (PHASE), crankshaft position sensor (POS). PBIB1164E PBIB0090E PBIB1512E  Do not disassemble ECM.  If battery cable is disconnected, the memory will return to the initial ECM values. The ECM will now start to self-control at its initial values. Engine operation can vary slightly when the cable is disconnected. However, this is not an indication of a malfunction. Do not replace parts because of a slight variation.  If the battery is disconnected, the following emissionrelated diagnostic information will be lost within 24 hours. -Diagnostic trouble codes -1st trip diagnostic trouble codes -Freeze frame data -1st trip freeze frame data -System readiness test (SRT) codes -Test values  When connecting ECM harness connector, fasten it securely with a lever as far as it will go as shown in the figure. MEF040D  When measuring ECM signals with a circuit tester, never allow the two tester probes to contact. Accidental contact of probes will cause a short circuit and damage the ECM power transistor.  Do not use ECM ground terminals when measuring input/ output voltage. Doing so may result in damage to the ECM s transistor. Use a ground other than ECM terminals, such as the ground. BBIA0529E  When installing C.B. ham radio or a mobile phone, be sure to observe the following as it may adversely affect electronic control systems depending on installation location.-Keep the antenna as far as possible from the electronic control units. -Keep the antenna feeder line more than 20 cm (8 in) away from the harness of electronic controls. Do not let them run parallel for a long distance. -Adjust the antenna and feeder line so that the standingwave radio can be kept smaller. Be sure to ground the radio to vehicle body. - SEF709Y SEF708Y  Do not depress accelerator pedal when starting. Immediately after starting, do not rev up engine unnecessarily.  Do not rev up engine just prior to shutdown."
"2 The mixture ratio feedback control system monitors the mixture ratio signal transmitted from air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1. This feedback signal is then sent to the ECM. The ECM controls the basic mixture ratio as close to the theoretical mixture ratio as possible. However, the basic mixture ratio is not necessarily controlled as originally designed. Both manufacturing differences (i.e., mass air flow sensor hot wire) and characteristic changes during operation (i.e., fuel injector clogging) directly affect mixture ratio. Accordingly, the difference between the basic and theoretical mixture ratios is monitored in this system. This is then computed in terms of injection pulse duration to automatically compensate for the difference between the two ratios.  Fuel trim refers to the feedback compensation value compared against the basic injection duration. Fuel trim includes short term fuel trim and long term fuel trim.  Short term fuel trim is the short-term fuel compensation used to maintain the mixture ratio at its theoretical value. The signal from air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 indicates whether the mixture ratio is RICH or LEAN compared to the theoretical value. The signal then triggers a reduction in fuel volume if the mixture ratio is rich, and an increase in fuel volume if it is lean.  Long term fuel trim is overall fuel compensation carried out long-term to compensate for continual deviation of the short term fuel trim from the central value. Such deviation will occur due to individual engine differences, wear over time and changes in the usage environment. EC-30 The open loop system condition refers to when the ECM detects any of the following conditions. Feedback control stops in order to maintain stabilized fuel combustion.  Deceleration and acceleration  High-load, high-speed operation  Malfunction of air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 or its circuit  Insufficient activation of air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 at low engine coolant temperature  High engine coolant temperature  During warm-up  After shifting from N to D (A/T models)  When starting the engine PBIB3020E The mixture ratio feedback system provides the best air-fuel mixture ratio for driveability and emission control. The three way catalyst (manifold) can then better reduce CO, HC and NOx emissions. This system uses air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 in the exhaust manifold to monitor whether the engine operation is rich or lean. The ECM adjusts the injection pulse width according to the sensor voltage signal. For more information about air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1, refer to EC-221, DTC P0130 A/F SENSOR 1 . This maintains the mixture ratio within the range of stoichiometric (ideal air-fuel mixture). This stage is referred to as the closed loop control condition. Heated oxygen sensor 2 is located downstream of the three way catalyst (manifold). Even if the switching characteristics of air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 shift, the air-fuel ratio is controlled to stoichiometric by the signal from heated oxygen sensor 2. E Fuel is injected into each cylinder during each engine cycle according to the firing order. This system is used when the engine is running. FUEL INJECTION TIMING PBIB2037E H I J The evaporative emission system is used to reduce hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere from the fuel system. This reduction of hydrocarbons is accomplished by activated charcoals in the EVAP canister. The fuel vapor in the sealed fuel tank is led into the EVAP canister which contains activated carbon and the vapor is stored there when the engine is not operating or when refueling to the fuel tank. The vapor in the EVAP canister is purged by the air through the purge line to the intake manifold when the engine is operating. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is controlled by ECM. When the engine operates, the flow rate of vapor controlled by EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is proportionally regulated as the air flow increases. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve also shuts off the vapor purge line during decelerating. Check EVAP canister as follows: 1. Block port B. 2. Blow air into port A and check that it flows freely out of port C. 3. Release blocked port B. 4. Apply vacuum pressure to port B and check that vacuum pressure exists at the ports A and C. 5. Block port A and B. 6. Apply pressure to port C and check that there is no leakage. SEF445Y BBIA0639E SEF943S 2.

If out of specification, replace fuel filler cap as an assembly. CAUTION: Use only a genuine fuel filler cap as a replacement. If an incorrect fuel filler cap is used, the MIL may come on. Positive pressure is delivered to the EVAP system through the EVAP service port. If fuel vapor leakage in the EVAP system occurs, use a leak detector to locate the leak. BBIA0566E"

Apply battery voltage between the terminals of EVAP canister vent control valve to make a closed EVAP system. 4. To locate the leak, deliver positive pressure to the EVAP system until pressure gauge points reach 1.38 to 2.76 kPa (0.014 to 0.028 kg/cm$^{2}$, 0.2 to 0.4 psi). 5. Remove EVAP service port adapter and hose with pressure pump. 6. Locate the leak using a leak detector. Refer to EC-38, EVAPO- RATIVE EMISSION LINE DRAWING . BBIA0591E From the beginning of refueling, the air and vapor inside the fuel tank go through refueling EVAP vapor cut valve and EVAP/ORVR line to the EVAP canister. The vapor is absorbed by the EVAP canister and the air is released to the atmosphere. When the refueling has reached the full level of the fuel tank, the refueling EVAP vapor cut valve is closed and refueling is stopped because of auto shut-off. The vapor which was absorbed by the EVAP canister is purged during driving. WARNING: When conducting inspections below, be sure to observe the following:  Put a CAUTION: FLAMMABLE sign in workshop.  Do not smoke while servicing fuel system. Keep open flames and sparks away from work area.  Be sure to furnish the workshop with a CO2 fire extinguisher. CAUTION:  Before removing fuel line parts, carry out the following procedures: -Put drained fuel in an explosion-proof container and put lid on securely. -Release fuel pressure from fuel line. Refer to EC-85, FUEL PRESSURE RELEASE .-Disconnect battery ground cable.  Always replace O-ring when the fuel gauge retainer is removed.  Do not kink or twist hose and tube when they are installed.  Do not tighten hose and clamps excessively to avoid damaging hoses. After installation, run engine and check for fuel leaks at connection.  Do not attempt to top off the fuel tank after the fuel pump nozzle shuts off automatically. Continued refueling may cause fuel overflow, resulting in fuel spray and possibly a fire.

BBIA0568E This system returns blow-by gas to the intake manifold. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve is provided to conduct crankcase blow-by gas to the intake manifold. During partial throttle operation of the engine, the intake manifold sucks the blow-by gas through the PCV valve. Normally, the capacity of the valve is sufficient to handle any blow-by and a small amount of ventilating air. The ventilating air is then drawn from the air inlet tubes into the crankcase. In this process the air passes through the hose connecting air inlet tubes to rocker cover. Under full-throttle condition, the manifold vacuum is insufficient to draw the blow-by flow through the valve. The flow goes through the hose connection in the reverse direction.

"5 SEF543X FREEZE FRAME DATA AND 1ST TRIP FREEZE FRAME DATA The ECM records the driving conditions such as fuel system status, calculated load value, engine coolant temperature, short term fuel trim, long term fuel trim, engine speed, vehicle speed, absolute throttle position, base fuel schedule and intake air temperature at the moment a malfunction is detected. Data which are stored in the ECM memory, along with the 1st trip DTC, are called 1st trip freeze frame data. The data, stored together with the DTC data, are called freeze frame data and displayed on CONSULT-II or GST. The 1st trip freeze frame data can only be displayed on the CONSULT-II screen, not on the GST. For details, see EC-58, FREEZE FRAME DATA AND 1ST TRIP FREEZE FRAME DATA . Only one set of freeze frame data (either 1st trip freeze frame data or freeze frame data) can be stored in the ECM. 1st trip freeze frame data is stored in the ECM memory along with the 1st trip DTC. There is no priority for 1st trip freeze frame data and it is updated each time a different 1st trip DTC is detected. However, once freeze frame data (2nd trip detection/MIL on) is stored in the ECM memory, 1st trip freeze frame data is no longer stored. Remember, only one set of freeze frame data can be stored in the ECM. The ECM has the following priorities to update the data. PBIB0911E *1 EC-57  The SRT will indicate CMPLT at the time the respective self-diagnoses have one (1) OK result.  The emissions inspection requires CMPLT of the SRT only with OK self-diagnosis results. When, during SRT driving pattern, 1st trip DTC (NG) is detected prior to CMPLT of SRT, the self-diagnosis memory must be erased from ECM after repair.  If the 1st trip DTC is erased, all the SRT will indicate INCMP . NOTE: C SRT can be set as CMPLT together with the DTC(s). Therefore, DTC check must always be carried out prior to the state emission inspection even though the SRT indicates CMPLT . SRT Service Procedure D If a vehicle has failed the state emissions inspection due to one or more SRT items indicating INCMP , review the flowchart diagnostic sequence on the next page. How to Set SRT Code To set all SRT codes, self-diagnosis for the items indicated above must be performed one or more times. Each diagnosis may require a long period of actual driving under various conditions. WITH CONSULT-II Perform corresponding DTC Confirmation Procedure one by one based on Performance Priority in the table on EC-60, SRT Item . WITHOUT CONSULT-II The most efficient driving pattern in which SRT codes can be properly set is explained on the next page.

"40 DTC P0443 EVAP CANISTER PURGE VOLUME CONTROL SOLENOID VALVE [QR]  Without CONSULT-II Check air passage continuity of EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve under the following conditions. The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve uses a ON/ OFF duty to control the flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister. The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is moved by ON/OFF pulses from the ECM. The longer the ON pulse, the greater the amount of fuel vapor that will flow through the valve. *1: ECM determines the start signal status by the signal of engine speed and battery voltage. *2: This signal is sent to the ECM through CAN communication line. This system controls flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister. The opening of the vapor by-pass passage in the EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve changes to control the flow rate. The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve repeats ON/OFF operation according to the signal sent from the ECM. The opening of the valve varies for optimum engine control. The optimum value stored in the ECM is determined by considering various engine conditions. When the engine is operating, the flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister is regulated as the air flow changes.

"66 DTC P2A00 A/F SENSOR 1 Component Description The A/F sensor 1 is a planar dual-cell limit current sensor. The sensor element of the A/F sensor 1 is the combination of a Nernst concentration cell (sensor cell) with an oxygen-pump cell, which transports ions. It has a heater in the element. The sensor is capable of precise measurement = 1, but also in the lean and rich range. Together with its control electronics, the sensor outputs a clear, continuous signal throughout a wide range (0.7 < < air). The exhaust gas components diffuse through the diffusion gap at the electrode of the oxygen pump and Nernst concentration cell, where they are brought to thermodynamic balance. On Board Diagnosis Logic UBS00P0D To judge the malfunction, the A/F signal computed by ECM from the air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 signal is monitored not to be shifted to LEAN side or RICH side.

It will light up the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) to warn the driver of a malfunction causing emission deterioration. CAUTION:  Be sure to turn the ignition switch OFF and disconnect the negative battery cable before any repair or inspection work. The open/short circuit of related switches, sensors, solenoid valves, etc. will cause the MIL to light up.  Be sure to connect and lock the connectors securely after work. A loose (unlocked) connector will cause the MIL to light up due to the open circuit. (Be sure the connector is free from water, grease, dirt, bent terminals, etc.)  Certain systems and components, especially those related to OBD, may use a new style slidelocking type harness connector. For description and how to disconnect, refer to PG-83, HAR-NESS CONNECTOR .  Be sure to route and secure the harnesses properly after work. The interference of the harness with a bracket, etc. may cause the MIL to light up due to the short circuit.  Be sure to connect rubber tubes properly after work. A misconnected or disconnected rubber tube may cause the MIL to light up due to the malfunction of the EVAP system or fuel injection system, etc.  Be sure to erase the unnecessary malfunction information (repairs completed) from the ECM and TCM (Transmission control module) before returning the vehicle to the customer. Precaution  Always use a 12 volt battery as power source.  Do not attempt to disconnect battery cables while engine is running.  Before connecting or disconnecting the ECM harness connector, turn ignition switch OFF and disconnect negative battery cable. Failure to do so may damage the ECM because battery voltage is applied to ECM even if ignition switch is turned OFF.  Before removing parts, turn ignition switch OFF and then disconnect negative battery cable. UBS00LJR PBIB1512E PBIB1164E  Do not disassemble ECM.  If a battery cable is disconnected, the memory will return to the ECM value. The ECM will now start to self-control at its initial value. Engine operation can vary slightly when the terminal is disconnected. However, this is not an indication of a malfunction. Do not replace parts because of a slight variation.  If the battery is disconnected, the following emissionrelated diagnostic information will be lost within 24 hours. -Diagnostic trouble codes -1st trip diagnostic trouble codes -Freeze frame data -1st trip freeze frame data -System readiness test (SRT) codes Test values -  When connecting ECM harness connector, fasten it securely with levers as far as they will go as shown at right. PBIB0090E  When connecting or disconnecting pin connectors into or from ECM, take care not to damage pin terminals (bend or break). Make sure that there are not any bends or breaks on ECM pin terminal, when connecting pin connectors.  Securely connect ECM harness connectors. A poor connection can cause an extremely high (surge) voltage to develop in coil and condenser, thus resulting in damage to ICs.  Keep engine control system harness at least 10 cm (4 in) away from adjacent harness, to prevent engine control system malfunctions due to receiving external noise, degraded operation of ICs, etc.  Keep engine control system parts and harness dry.  Before replacing ECM, perform ECM Terminals and Reference Value inspection and make sure ECM functions properly. Refer to EC-716, ECM Terminals and Reference Value  .  Handle mass air flow sensor carefully to avoid damage. Do not clean mass air flow sensor with any type of detergent.  Do not disassemble electric throttle control actuator. Even a slight leak in the air intake system can cause serious incidents.  Do not shock or jar the camshaft position sensor (PHASE), crankshaft position sensor (POS).  After performing each TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS, perform DTC Confirmation Procedure or Overall Function Check. The DTC should not be displayed in the DTC Confirmation Procedure if the repair is completed. The Overall Function Check should be a good result if the repair is completed. SEF348N  B1 indicates the bank 1, B2 indicates the bank 2 as shown in the figure. SEF709Y"
"74  Do not depress accelerator pedal when starting. Immediately after starting, do not rev up engine unnecessarily.  Do not rev up engine just prior to shutdown. SEF708Y ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM System Diagram UBS00LJV The open loop system condition refers to when the ECM detects any of the following conditions. Feedback control stops in order to maintain stabilized fuel combustion.  Deceleration and acceleration  High-load, high-speed operation  Malfunction of air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 or its circuit  Insufficient activation of air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 at low engine coolant temperature  High engine coolant temperature  During warm-up  After shifting from N to D (A/T models)  When starting the engine PBIB3020E E F The mixture ratio feedback system provides the best air-fuel mixture ratio for driveability and emission control. The three way catalyst (manifold) can then better reduce CO, HC and NOx emissions. This system uses air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 in the exhaust manifold to monitor whether the engine operation is rich or lean. The ECM adjusts the injection pulse width according to the sensor voltage signal. For more information about air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1, refer to EC-849, DTC P0131, P0151 A/F SENSOR 1 . This maintains the mixture ratio within the range of stoichiometric (ideal air-fuel mixture). This stage is referred to as the closed loop control condition. Heated oxygen sensor 2 is located downstream of the three way catalyst (manifold). Even if the switching characteristics of air fuel ratio (A/F) sensor 1 shift, the air-fuel ratio is controlled to stoichiometric by the signal from heated oxygen sensor 2. Fuel is injected into each cylinder during each engine cycle according to the firing order. This system is used when the engine is running. Two types of systems are used. EVAPORATIVE EMISSION SYSTEM The evaporative emission system is used to reduce hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere from the fuel system. This reduction of hydrocarbons is accomplished by activated charcoals in the EVAP canister. The fuel vapor in the sealed fuel tank is led into the EVAP canister which contains activated carbon and the vapor is stored there when the engine is not operating or when refueling to the fuel tank. The vapor in the EVAP canister is purged by the air through the purge line to the intake manifold when the engine is operating. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is controlled by ECM. When the engine operates, the flow rate of vapor controlled by EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is proportionally regulated as the air flow increases. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve also shuts off the vapor purge line during decelerating. PBIB1631E Check EVAP canister as follows: 1. Block port B. 2. Blow air into port A and check that it flows freely out of port C. 3. Release blocked port B. 4. Apply vacuum pressure to port B and check that vacuum pressure exists at the ports A and C. 5. Block port A and B. 6. Apply pressure to port C and check that there is no leakage. SEF943S Positive pressure is delivered to the EVAP system through the EVAP service port. If fuel vapor leakage in the EVAP system occurs, use a leak detector to locate the leak. BBIA0566E"

To locate the leak, deliver positive pressure to the EVAP system until pressure gauge points reach 1.38 to 2.76 kPa (0.014 to 0.028 kg/cm$^{2}$, 0.2 to 0.4 psi). 5. Remove EVAP service port adapter and hose with pressure pump. 6. Locate the leak using a leak detector. Refer to EC-643, EVAP-ORATIVE EMISSION LINE DRAWING . BBIA0591E From the beginning of refueling, the air and vapor inside the fuel tank go through refueling EVAP vapor cut valve and EVAP/ORVR line to the EVAP canister. The vapor is absorbed by the EVAP canister and the air is released to the atmosphere. When the refueling has reached the full level of the fuel tank, the refueling EVAP vapor cut valve is closed and refueling is stopped because of auto shut-off. The vapor which was absorbed by the EVAP canister is purged during driving. WARNING: When conducting inspections below, be sure to observe the following:  Put a CAUTION: FLAMMABLE sign in workshop.  Do not smoke while servicing fuel system. Keep open flames and sparks away from work area.  Be sure to furnish the workshop with a CO2 fire extinguisher. CAUTION:  Before removing fuel line parts, carry out the following procedures:-Put drained fuel in an explosion-proof container and put lid on securely. -Release fuel pressure from fuel line. Refer to Fuel Pressure Release, EC-690, FUEL PRESSURE RELEASE . -Disconnect battery negative cable.  Always replace O-ring when the fuel gauge retainer is removed.  Do not kink or twist hose and tube when they are installed.  Do not tighten hose and clamps excessively to avoid damaging hoses.  After installation, run engine and check for fuel leaks at connection.  Do not attempt to top off the fuel tank after the fuel pump nozzle shuts off automatically. Continued refueling may cause fuel overflow, resulting in fuel spray and possibly a fire. ON BOARD REFUELING VAPOR RECOVERY (ORVR) System Description >> GO TO 4. 4.

SEC921C PBIB1589E This system returns blow-by gas to the intake manifold. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve is provided to conduct crankcase blow-by gas to the intake manifold. During partial throttle operation of the engine, the intake manifold sucks the blow-by gas through the PCV valve. Normally, the capacity of the valve is sufficient to handle any blow-by and a small amount of ventilating air. The ventilating air is then drawn from the air inlet tubes into the crankcase. In this process the air passes through the hose connecting air inlet tubes to rocker cover. Under full-throttle condition, the manifold vacuum is insufficient to draw the blow-by flow through the valve. The flow goes through the hose connection in the reverse direction.

"77 For malfunctions in which 1st trip DTCs are displayed, refer to EC-658, EMISSION-RELATED DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION ITEMS . These items are required by legal regulations to continuously monitor the system/ component. In addition, the items monitored non-continuously are also displayed on CONSULT-II. 1st trip DTC is specified in Service $07 of SAE J1979. 1st trip DTC detection occurs without lighting up the MIL and therefore does not warn the driver of a malfunction. However, 1st trip DTC detection will not prevent the vehicle from being tested, for example during Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) tests. When a 1st trip DTC is detected, check, print out or write down and erase (1st trip) DTC and Freeze Frame data as specified in Work Flow procedure Step 2, refer to EC-694, WORK FLOW . Then perform DTC Con-fir mation Procedure or Overall Function Check to try to duplicate the malfunction. If the malfunction is duplicated, the item requires repair. How to Read DTC and 1st Trip DTC DTC and 1st trip DTC can be read by the following methods. With CONSULT-II With GST CONSULT-II or GST (Generic Scan Tool) Examples: P0340, P0850, P1148, etc. These DTCs are prescribed by SAE J2012. (CONSULT-II also displays the malfunctioning component or system.) No Tools The number of blinks of the MIL in the Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-Diagnostic Results) indicates the DTC. Example: 0340, 0850 1148, etc. These DTCs are controlled by NISSAN.  1st trip DTC No. is the same as DTC No.  Output of a DTC indicates a malfunction. However, GST or the Diagnostic Test Mode II do not indicate whether the malfunction is still occurring or has occurred in the past and has returned to normal. CONSULT-II can identify malfunction status as shown below. Therefore, using CONSULT-II (if available) is recommended. A sample of CONSULT-II display for DTC and 1st trip DTC is shown below. DTC or 1st trip DTC of a malfunction is displayed in SELF-DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS mode of CONSULT-II. Time data indicates how many times the vehicle was driven after the last detection of a DTC. If the DTC is being detected currently, the time data will be [0]. If a 1st trip DTC is stored in the ECM, the time data will be [1t]. FREEZE FRAME DATA AND 1ST TRIP FREEZE FRAME DATA The ECM records the driving conditions such as fuel system status, calculated load value, engine coolant temperature, short term fuel trim, long term fuel trim, engine speed, vehicle speed, absolute throttle position, base fuel schedule and intake air temperature at the moment a malfunction is detected. Data which are stored in the ECM memory, along with the 1st trip DTC, are called 1st trip freeze frame data. The data, stored together with the DTC data, are called freeze frame data and displayed on CONSULT-II or GST. The 1st trip freeze frame data can only be displayed on the CONSULT-II screen, not on the GST. For details, see EC-728, Freeze Frame Data and 1st Trip Freeze Frame Data . Only one set of freeze frame data (either 1st trip freeze frame data or freeze frame data) can be stored in the ECM. 1st trip freeze frame data is stored in the ECM memory along with the 1st trip DTC. There is no priority for 1st trip freeze frame data and it is updated each time a different 1st trip DTC is detected. However, once freeze frame data (2nd trip detection/MIL on) is stored in the ECM memory, 1st trip freeze frame data is no longer stored. Remember, only one set of freeze frame data can be stored in the ECM. The ECM has the following priorities to update the data. PBIB0911E Though displayed on the CONSULT-II screen, HO2S HTR is not SRT item. *2 EC-665 *3 EC-666 PBIB2320E SEF935Z WITH GST Selecting Service $01 with GST (Generic Scan Tool) NO TOOLS A SRT code itself can no be displayed while only SRT status can be. 1. Turn ignition switch ON and wait 20 seconds. 2. SRT status is indicated as shown below.  When all SRT codes are set, MIL lights up continuously.  When any SRT codes are not set, MIL will flash periodically for 10 seconds. How to Set SRT Code To set all SRT codes, self-diagnosis for the items indicated above must be performed one or more times. Each diagnosis may require a long period of actual driving under various conditions. WITH CONSULT-II Perform corresponding DTC Confirmation Procedure one by one based on Performance Priority in the table on EC-663, SRT Item . WITHOUT CONSULT-II The most efficient driving pattern in which SRT codes can be properly set is explained on the next page. The driving pattern should be performed one or more times to set all SRT codes. PBIB2317E With GST The emission related diagnostic information in the ECM can be erased by selecting Service $04 with GST. NOTE: If the DTC is not for A/T related items (see EC-619), skip step 2. 1.

Refer to EC-673, How to Set Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-diagnostic Results) . 2. Fully depress the accelerator pedal and keep it for more than 10 seconds. The emission-related diagnostic information has been erased from the backup memory in the ECM. 3. Fully release the accelerator pedal, and confirm the DTC 0000 is displayed. PBIB0092E PBIB3005E K A particular trouble code can be identified by the number of four-digit numeral flashes. The zero is indicated by the number of ten flashes. The A is indicated by the number of eleven flash. The length of time the 1,000th-digit numeral flashes on and off is 1.2 seconds consisting of an ON (0.6-second)-OFF (0.6-second) cycle. L M The 100th-digit numeral and lower digit numerals consist of a 0.3-second ON and 0.3-second OFF cycle. A change from one digit numeral to another occurs at an interval of 1.0-second OFF. In other words, the later numeral appears on the display 1.3 seconds after the former numeral has disappeared. A change from one trouble code to another occurs at an interval of 1.8-second OFF. In this way, all the detected malfunctions are classified by their DTC numbers. The DTC 0000 refers to no mal- function. (See EC-619, INDEX FOR DTC ) How to Erase Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-diagnostic Results) The DTC can be erased from the back up memory in the ECM by depressing accelerator pedal.

Ground Inspection  UBS00LLC EC Ground connections are very important to the proper operation of electrical and electronic circuits. Ground connections are often exposed to moisture, dirt and other corrosive elements. The corrosion (rust) can become an unwanted resistance. This unwanted resistance can change the way a circuit works. Electronically controlled circuits are very sensitive to proper grounding. A loose or corroded ground can drastically affect an electronically controlled circuit. A poor or corroded ground can easily affect the circuit. Even when the ground connection looks clean, there can be a thin film of rust on the surface. When inspecting a ground connection follow these rules:  Remove the ground bolt or screw.  Inspect all mating surfaces for tarnish, dirt, rust, etc.  Clean as required to assure good contact.  Reinstall bolt or screw securely. Inspect for add-on accessories which may be interfering with the ground circuit.    If several wires are crimped into one ground eyelet terminal, check for proper crimps. Make sure all of the wires are clean, securely fastened and providing a good ground path. If multiple wires are cased in one eyelet make sure no ground wires have excess wire insulation.

UBS00LZG BBIA0569E PBIB1822E When the engine is running at medium speed, the ECM sends the ON signal to the VIAS control solenoid valve. This signal introduces the intake manifold vacuum into the power valve actuator and therefore closes the power valve. Under this condition, the effective intake manifold length is equivalent to the total length of passage A and passage B. This long intake manifold provides increased amount of intake air, which results in improved suction efficiency and higher torque. When engine is running at low or high speed, the ECM sends the OFF signal to the VIAS control solenoid valve and the power valve is opened. Under this condition, the effective intake manifold length is equivalent to the length of passage B. This shortened intake manifold length results in enhanced engine output due to reduced suction resistance under high speeds. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION Power Valve The power valve is installed in intake manifold collector and used to control the suction passage of the variable induction air control system. It is set in the fully closed or fully opened position by the power valve actuator operated by the vacuum stored in the surge tank. The vacuum in the surge tank is controlled by the VIAS control solenoid valve. VIAS Control Solenoid Valve The VIAS control solenoid valve cuts the intake manifold vacuum signal for power valve control. It responds to ON/OFF signals from the ECM. When the solenoid is OFF, the vacuum signal from the intake manifold is cut. When the ECM sends an ON signal the coil pulls the plunger downward and feeds the vacuum signal to the power valve actuator.

INSPECTION AFTER INSTALLATION Inspection for Leaks The following are procedures for checking fluid leaks, lubricates leak and exhaust gases leak.  Before starting the engine, check oil fluid levels including engine coolant and engine oil. If less than required quantity, fill to the specified level. Refer to MA-11, QR25DE .  Use procedures below to check for fuel leakage.  Turn ignition switch ON (with engine stopped). With fuel pressure applied to fuel piping, check for fuel leakage at connection points.  Start the engine. With the engine speed increased, check again for fuel leakage at connection points. Run the engine to check for unusual noise and vibration. NOTE:   If hydraulic pressure inside timing chain tensioner drops after removal/installation, slack in the guide may generate a pounding noise during and just after the engine start. However, this is normal. Noise will stop after hydraulic pressure rises.  Warm up the engine thoroughly to make sure there is no leakage of fuel, exhaust gases, or any oil/ fluids including engine oil and engine coolant.  Bleed air from lines and hoses of applicable lines, such as in cooling system.  After cooling down the engine, again check oil/fluid levels including engine oil and engine coolant. Refill to the specified level, if necessary. KBIA2491E CYLINDER BLOCK Disassembly and Assembly 1. Cylinder block 2. O-ring 5. Oil pressure switch 8. Oil level gauge guide 11.

NOTE: If alignment is out of specification, inspect and replace any damaged or worn rear suspension parts before making any adjustments. 1. Check and adjust the wheel alignment with the vehicle under unladen conditions. Unladen conditions means that the fuel, coolant, and lubricant are full; and that the spare tire, jack, hand tools and mats are in their designated positions. 2. Check the tires for incorrect air pressure and excessive wear. 3. Check the wheels for run out and damage. Refer to WT-5, Inspection . 4. Check the wheel bearing axial end play. Refer to FAX-5, WHEEL BEARING INSPECTION  . 5. Check the shock absorbers for leaks or damage. 6. Check each mounting point of the suspension components for any excessive looseness or damage. 7. Check each link, arm, and the suspension member for any damage. 8. Check the vehicle height. Refer to FSU-21, Wheelarch Height (Unladen*$^{1}$) . GENERAL INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. A Four-Wheel Thrust Alignment should be performed.  This type of alignment is recommended for any NISSAN vehicle.  The four-wheel thrust process helps ensure that the vehicle is properly aligned and the steering wheel is centered.  The alignment machine itself should be capable of accepting any NISSAN vehicle.  The alignment machine should be checked to ensure that it is level. 2. Make sure the alignment machine is properly calibrated. NOTE: Some vehicles may be equipped with straight (non-adjustable) lower link bolts and washers. In order to adjust camber and caster on these vehicles, first replace the lower link bolts and washers with adjustable (cam) bolts and washers. 3. Tighten the adjusting bolt nuts to specification. Refer to FSU-5, Components . A Your alignment machine should be regularly calibrated in order to give correct information. Check with the manufacturer of your specific alignment machine for their recommended Service/Calibration Schedule. THE ALIGNMENT PROCESS B IMPORTANT: Use only the alignment specifications listed in this Service Manual. Refer to FSU-20, Wheel Alignment (Unladen*1)*6 . C 1. When displaying the alignment settings, many alignment machines use indicators : (Green/red, plus or minus, Go/No Go). Do NOT use these indicators.  The alignment specifications programmed into your alignment machine that operate these indicators may not be correct.  This may result in an ERROR. FSU 2. Some newer alignment machines are equipped with an optional Rolling Compensation method to compensate the sensors (alignment targets or head units). Do NOT use this Rolling Compensation method.  Use the Jacking Compensation method. After installing the alignment targets or head units, raise the vehicle and rotate the wheels 1/2 turn both ways.  See Instructions in the alignment machine you are using for more information. CAMBER AND CASTER 1. Measure camber and caster of both the right and left wheels with a suitable alignment gauge and adjust as necessary to specification. Camber : Refer to FSU-20, Wheel Alignment  (Unladen*1)*6 . 4. Measure the distance A on the rear side of the front tires as shown. 5. Push the vehicle slowly ahead to rotate the wheels 180 degrees (1/2 a turn). CAUTION: If the wheels have rotated more than 180 degrees (1/2 turn), start this procedure again from the beginning. Never push the vehicle backward. 6. Measure the distance B on the front side of the front tires at the same marks as shown. Total toe-in is calculated as A - B . Total toe-in : Refer to FSU-20, Wheel Alignment  (Unladen*1)*6 . 7. Adjust the toe-in by varying the length of the steering outer tierods. a. Loosen the outer tie-rod lock nuts. b. Adjust the toe-in by screwing the outer tie-rods in or out.

"1 SGI231 EAS001G7 Observe the following precautions to ensure safe and proper servicing. These precautions are not described in each individual section. Precautions for Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER EAS001G8 C D E The Supplemental Restraint System such as AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER , used along with a front seat belt, helps to reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger for certain types of collision. This system includes seat belt switch inputs and dual stage front air bag modules. The SRS system uses the seat belt switches to determine the front air bag deployment, and may only deploy one front air bag, depending on the severity of a collision and whether the front occupants are belted or unbelted. Information necessary to service the system safely is included in the SRS and SB section of this Service Manual. WARNING:  To avoid rendering the SRS inoperative, which could increase the risk of personal injury or death in the event of a collision which would result in air bag inflation, all maintenance must be performed by an authorized NISSAN/INFINITI dealer.  Improper maintenance, including incorrect removal and installation of the SRS, can lead to personal injury caused by unintentional activation of the system. For removal of Spiral Cable and Air Bag Module, see the SRS section.  Do not use electrical test equipment on any circuit related to the SRS unless instructed to in this Service Manual. SRS wiring harnesses can be identified by yellow and/or orange harnesses or harness connectors. General Precautions EAS001G9  Do not operate the engine for an extended period of time without proper exhaust ventilation. Keep the work area well ventilated and free of any inflammable materials. Special care should be taken when handling any inflammable or poisonous materials, such as gasoline, refrigerant gas, etc. When working in a pit or other enclosed area, be sure to properly ventilate the area before working with hazardous materials. Do not smoke while working on the vehicle.  Before jacking up the vehicle, apply wheel chocks or other tire blocks to the wheels to prevent the vehicle from moving. After jacking up the vehicle, support the vehicle weight with safety stands at the points designated for proper lifting before working on the vehicle. These operations should be done on a level surface.  When removing a heavy component such as the engine or transaxle/transmission, be careful not to lose your balance and drop them. Also, do not allow them to strike adjacent parts, especially the brake tubes and master cylinder. SGI285 Before starting repairs which do not require battery power: Turn off ignition switch. Disconnect the negative battery terminal.  If the battery terminals are disconnected, recorded memory of radio and each control unit is erased.  To prevent serious burns: Avoid contact with hot metal parts. Do not remove the radiator cap when the engine is hot.  Dispose of drained oil or the solvent used for cleaning parts in an appropriate manner.  Do not attempt to top off the fuel tank after the fuel pump nozzle shuts off automatically. Continued refueling may cause fuel overflow, resulting in fuel spray and possibly a fire.  Clean all disassembled parts in the designated liquid or solvent prior to inspection or assembly. SGI233  Replace oil seals, gaskets, packings, O-rings, locking washers, cotter pins, self-locking nuts, etc. with new ones.  Replace inner and outer races of tapered roller bearings and needle bearings as a set.  Arrange the disassembled parts in accordance with their assembled locations and sequence. Do not touch the terminals of electrical components which use microcomputers (such as ECM). Static electricity may damage internal electronic components.  After disconnecting vacuum or air hoses, attach a tag to indicate the proper connection.  Use only the fluids and lubricants specified in this manual.  Use approved bonding agent, sealants or their equivalents when required.  Use hand tools, power tools (disassembly only) and recommended special tools where specified for safe and efficient service repairs.  When repairing the fuel, oil, water, vacuum or exhaust systems, check all affected lines for leaks. SEF289H PBIC0190E Before servicing the vehicle: Protect fenders, upholstery and carpeting with appropriate covers. Take caution that keys, buckles or buttons do not scratch paint. SGI234 CAUTION: H I Do not use leaded gasoline. Using leaded gasoline will damage the three way catalyst. Do not use E-85 fuel (85% fuel ethanol, 15% unleaded gasoline) unless the vehicle is specifically designed for E-85 fuel (i.e. Flexible Fuel Vehicle-FFV models). Using a fuel other than that specified could adversely affect the emission control devices and systems, and could also affect the warranty coverage validity. VQ40DE MODELS J Use unleaded regular gasoline with an octane rating of at least 87 AKI (Anti-Knock Index) number (Research octane number 91). E-85 fuel (85% fuel ethanol, 15% unleaded gasoline) may only be used in vehicles specifically designed for E-85 fuel (i.e. Flexible Fuel Vehicles-FFV models). K For improved vehicle performance, NISSAN/INFINITI recommend the use of unleaded premium gasoline with an octane rating of at least 91 AKI number (Research octane number 96). L M CAUTION: Do not use leaded gasoline. Using leaded gasoline will damage the three way catalyst. Do not use E-85 fuel (85% fuel ethanol, 15% unleaded gasoline) unless the vehicle is specifically designed for E-85 fuel (i.e. Flexible Fuel Vehicle-FFV models). Using a fuel other than that specified could adversely affect the emission control devices and systems, and could also affect the warranty coverage validity. Precautions for Multiport Fuel Injection System or Engine Control System EAS001GC Before connecting or disconnecting any harness connector for the multiport fuel injection system or ECM: Turn ignition switch to OFF position. Disconnect negative battery terminal.   Otherwise, there may be damage to ECM. Before disconnecting pressurized fuel line from fuel pump to injectors, be sure to release fuel pressure. Be careful not to jar components such as ECM and mass ai rflow sensor.  To reinstall the rubber hose securely, make sure of hose insertion length and clamp orientation. (If tube is equipped with hose stopper, insert rubber hose into tube until it butts up against hose stopper.) SMA022D Precautions for Engine Oils EAS001GE Prolonged and repeated contact with used engine oil may cause skin cancer. Try to avoid direct skin contact with used oil. If skin contact is made, wash thoroughly with soap or hand cleaner as soon as possible. HEALTH PROTECTION PRECAUTIONS   Avoid prolonged and repeated contact with oils, particularly used engine oils."

"3 AGI070 Detectable Lines and Non-Detectable Lines  In some wiring diagrams, two kinds of lines, representing wires, with different weight are used.  A line with regular weight (wider line) represents a detectable line for DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) . A detectable line for DTC is a circuit in which ECM can detect its malfunctions with the on board diagnostic system.  A line with less weight (thinner line) represents a non-detectable line for DTC . A non-detectable line for DTC is a circuit in which ECM cannot detect its malfunctions with the on board diagnostic system. Multiple Switch  The continuity of multiple switch is described in two ways as shown below. The switch chart is used in schematic diagrams. SGI862-B SGI875 SGI092A EAS001GN Reference Area The Reference Area of the wiring diagram contains references to additional electrical reference pages at the end of the manual. If connector numbers and titles are shown in the Reference Area of the wiring diagram, these connector symbols are not shown in the Connector Area. Probing from Terminal Side FEMALE TERMINAL  There is a small notch above each female terminal. Probe each terminal with the T pin through the notch. Do not insert any object other than the same type male terminal into female terminal. GI-24 EAS001GO HOW TO PROBE CONNECTORS Connector damage and an intermittent connection can result from improperly probing of the connector during circuit checks. The probe of a digital multimeter (DMM) may not correctly fit the connector cavity. To correctly probe the connector, follow the procedures below using a T pin. For the best contact grasp the T pin using an alligator clip. Probing from Harness Side  Standard type (not waterproof type) connector should be probed from harness side with T pin.  If the connector has a rear cover such as a ECM connector, remove the rear cover before probing the terminal.  Do not probe waterproof connector from harness side. Damage to the seal between wire and connector may result. SERVICE INFORMATION FOR ELECTRICAL INCIDENT How to Check Terminal  CONNECTOR AND TERMINAL PIN KIT Use the connector and terminal pin kits listed below when replacing connectors or terminals. The connector and terminal pin kits contain some of the most commonly used NISSAN/INFINITI connectors and terminals. For detailed connector and terminal pin replacement procedures, refer to the latest NISSAN/ INFINITI CONNECTOR AND TERMINAL PIN SERVICE MANUAL. Tool number (Kent-Moore No.) Tool name WAIA0005E"
"4 SGI841 Some connectors do not have a notch above each terminal. To probe each terminal, remove the connector retainer to make contact space for probing. How to Check Enlarged Contact Spring of Terminal  An enlarged contact spring of a terminal may create intermittent signals in the circuit. If the intermittent open circuit occurs, follow the procedure below to inspect for open wires and enlarged contact spring of female terminal. Assemble a male terminal and approx. 10 cm (3.9 in) of wire. Use a male terminal which matches the female terminal. Disconnect the suspected faulty connector and hold it terminal side up. SEL267V WIRE SEAL INSPECTION The wire seal must be installed on the wire insertion area of a waterproof connector. Be sure that the seal is installed properly. Terminal Lock Inspection  Check for unlocked terminals by pulling wire at the end of connector. An unlocked terminal may create intermittent signals in the circuit. GI-26 RUBBER SEAL INSPECTION  Most waterproof connectors are provided with a rubber seal between the male and female connectors. If the seal is missing, the waterproof performance may not meet specifications.  The rubber seal may come off when connectors are disconnected. Whenever connectors are reconnected, make sure the rubber seal is properly installed on either side of male or female connector. Waterproof Connector Inspection  If water enters the connector, it can short interior circuits. This may lead to intermittent problems. Check the following items to maintain the original waterproof characteristics. SEL275V BEHIND THE INSTRUMENT PANEL An improperly routed or improperly clamped harness can become pinched during accessory installation. Vehicle vibration can aggravate a harness which is routed along a bracket or near a screw. GI-28 SENSORS & RELAYS Gently apply a slight vibration to sensors and relays in the system you are inspecting. This test may indicate a loose or poorly mounted sensor or relay. ENGINE COMPARTMENT There are several reasons a vehicle or engine vibration could cause an electrical complaint. Some of the things to check for are:  Connectors not fully seated.  Wiring harness not long enough and is being stressed due to engine vibrations or rocking.  Wires laying across brackets or moving components.  Loose, dirty or corroded ground wires.  Wires routed too close to hot components. To inspect components under the hood, start by verifying the integrity of ground connections. (Refer to Ground Inspection described later.) First check that the system is properly grounded. Then check for loose connection by gently shaking the wiring or components as previously explained. Using the wiring diagrams inspect the wiring for continuity. SGI839"
"5 GI An unclamped or loose harness can cause wiring to be pinched by seat components (such as slide guides) during vehicle vibration. If the wiring runs under seating areas, inspect wire routing for possible damage or pinching. Heat Sensitive  The customer s concern may occur during hot weather or after car has sat for a short time. In such cases you will want to check for a heat sensitive condition. To determine if an electrical component is heat sensitive, heat the component with a heat gun or equivalent. Do not heat components above 60 C (140 F). If incident occurs while heating the unit, either replace or properly insulate the component. Freezing  The customer may indicate the incident goes away after the car warms up (winter time). The cause could be related to water freezing somewhere in the wiring/electrical system. There are two methods to check for this. The first is to arrange for the owner to leave his car overnight. Make sure it will get cold enough to demonstrate his complaint. Leave the car parked outside overnight. In the morning, do a quick and thorough diagnosis of those electrical components which could be affected. The second method is to put the suspect component into a freezer long enough for any water to freeze. Reinstall the part into the car and check for the reoccurrence of the incident. If it occurs, repair or replace the component. Water Intrusion  The incident may occur only during high humidity or in rainy/snowy weather. In such cases the incident could be caused by water intrusion on an electrical part. This can be simulated by soaking the car or running it through a car wash. Do not spray water directly on any electrical components. SGI842 SGI844 SGI845 Electrical Load  The incident may be electrical load sensitive. Perform diagnosis with all accessories (including A/C, rear window defogger, radio, fog lamps) turned on. Cold or Hot Start Up  On some occasions an electrical incident may occur only when the car is started cold, or it may occur when the car is restarted hot shortly after being turned off. In these cases you may have to keep the car overnight to make a proper diagnosis. NOTE: Refer to How to Check Terminal to probe or check terminal. Testing for Opens in the Circuit  Before you begin to diagnose and test the system, you should rough sketch a schematic of the system. This will help you to logically walk through the diagnosis process. Drawing the sketch will also reinforce your working knowledge of the system. CONTINUITY CHECK METHOD The continuity check is used to find an open in the circuit. The digital multimeter (DMM) set on the resistance function will indicate an open circuit as over limit (no beep tone or no ohms symbol). Make sure to always start with the DMM at the highest resistance level.  To help in understanding the diagnosis of open circuits, please refer to the previous schematic.  Disconnect the battery negative cable.  Start at one end of the circuit and work your way to the other end. (At the fuse block in this example) Connect one probe of the DMM to the fuse block terminal on the load side.  Connect the other probe to the fuse block (power) side of SW1. Little or no resistance will indicate that portion of the circuit has good continuity. If there were an open in the circuit, the DMM would indicate an over limit or infinite resistance condition. (point A)  Connect the probes between SW1 and the relay. Little or no resistance will indicate that portion of the circuit has good continuity. If there were an open in the circuit, the DMM would indicate an over limit or infinite resistance condition. (point B)  Connect the probes between the relay and the solenoid. Little or no resistance will indicate that portion of the circuit has good continuity. If there were an open in the circuit, the DMM would indicate an over limit or infinite resistance condition. (point C) Any circuit can be diagnosed using the approach in the previous example. SGI846-A To simplify the discussion of shorts in the system, please refer to the following schematic. RESISTANCE CHECK METHOD  Disconnect the battery negative cable and remove the blown fuse.  Disconnect all loads (SW1 open, relay disconnected and solenoid disconnected) powered through the fuse.  Connect one probe of the DMM to the load side of the fuse terminal. Connect the other probe to a known good ground. With SW1 open, check for continuity. continuity; short is between fuse terminal and SW1 (point A). no continuity; short is further down the circuit than SW1.    Close SW1 and disconnect the relay. Put probes at the load side of fuse terminal and a known good ground. Then, check for continuity. continuity; short is between SW1 and the relay (point B). no continuity; short is further down the circuit than the relay.  Close SW1 and jump the relay contacts with jumper wire. Put probes at the load side of fuse terminal and a known good ground. Then, check for continuity. continuity; short is between relay and solenoid (point C). no continuity; check solenoid, retrace steps. SGI847-A no voltage; short is further down the circuit than the relay.  With SW1 closed, relay contacts jumped with fused jumper wire check for voltage. voltage; short is down the circuit of the relay or between the relay and the disconnected solenoid (point C). no voltage; retrace steps and check power to fuse block. Ground Inspection  Ground connections are very important to the proper operation of electrical and electronic circuits. Ground connections are often exposed to moisture, dirt and other corrosive elements. The corrosion (rust) can become an unwanted resistance. This unwanted resistance can change the way a circuit works. Electronically controlled circuits are very sensitive to proper grounding. A loose or corroded ground can drastically affect an electronically controlled circuit. A poor or corroded ground can easily affect the circuit. Even when the ground connection looks clean, there can be a thin film of rust on the surface. When inspecting a ground connection follow these rules:  Remove the ground bolt or screw.  Inspect all mating surfaces for tarnish, dirt, rust, etc.  Clean as required to assure good contact.  Reinstall bolt or screw securely.  Inspect for add-on accessories which may be interfering with the ground circuit.  If several wires are crimped into one ground eyelet terminal, check for proper crimps. Make sure all of the wires are clean, securely fastened and providing a good ground path. If multiple wires are cased in one eyelet make sure no ground wires have excess wire insulation. For detailed ground distribution information, refer to Ground Distribution in PG section."
"6  Connect the DMM across the connector or part of the circuit you want to check. The positive lead of the DMM should be closer to power and the negative lead closer to ground.  Operate the circuit. The DMM will indicate how many volts are being used to push current through that part of the circuit. Note in the illustration that there is an excessive 4.1 volt drop between the battery and the bulb. MEASURING VOLTAGE DROP-STEP-BY-STEP The step-by-step method is most useful for isolating excessive drops in low voltage systems (such as those in Computer Controlled Systems ). Circuits in the Computer Controlled System operate on very low amperage. The (Computer Controlled) system operations can be adversely affected by any variation in resistance in the system. Such resistance variation may be caused by poor connection, improper installation, improper wire gauge or corrosion. The step by step voltage drop test can identify a component or wire with too much resistance. SGI974 SAIA0258E The voltage value is based on the body ground. *:If high resistance exists in the switch side circuit (caused by a single strand), terminal 2 does not detect approx. 0V. Control unit does not detect the switch is ON even if the switch does not turn ON. Therefore, the control unit does not control ground to light up the lamp. GI-34 INPUT-OUTPUT VOLTAGE CHART Control Unit Circuit Test  System Description:When the switch is ON, the control unit lights up the lamp. The voltage value is based on the body ground. *:If high resistance exists in the switch side circuit (caused by a single strand), terminal 1 does not detect battery voltage. Control unit does not detect the switch is ON even if the switch does not turn ON. Therefore, the control unit does not supply power to light up the lamp. INPUT-OUTPUT VOLTAGE CHART MGI035A  Before installing a connector, make sure the terminal is not bent or damaged, and then correctly connect it. When installing a connector by tightening bolts, fix it by tightening the mounting bolt until the painted projection of the connector becomes even with the surface.  SAIA0254E  Do not apply excessive shock to the control unit by dropping or hitting it.  Be careful to prevent condensation in the control unit due to rapid temperature changes and do not let water or rain get on it. If water is found in the control unit, dry it fully and then install it in the vehicle.  Be careful not to let oil to get on the control unit connector.  Avoid cleaning the control unit with volatile oil.  Do not disassemble the control unit, and do not remove the upper and lower covers."
"7 SAIA0255E  When using a DMM, be careful not to let test probes get close to each other to prevent the power transistor in the control unit from damaging battery voltage because of short circuiting.  When checking input and output signals of the control unit, use the specified check adapter.

"1 SQUEAK AND RATTLE TROUBLE DIAGNOSES Work Flow EIS0053G CUSTOMER INTERVIEW Interview the customer if possible, to determine the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer to GW-9, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs.  The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur).  If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer.   After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise. L Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.   Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor) M Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity.  Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance.  Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action.  Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions.  Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity. Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact.  Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person. A noise that you may judge as acceptable may be very irritating to the customer. Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature, may have a great effect on noise level.   Diagnostic Worksheet PIIA0186E Molding Mirror base REMOVAL 1. Remove inside mirror. Refer to GW-66, INSIDE MIRROR . 2. Partially remove the headlining (front edge). Refer to EI-42, HEADLINING . 3. Remove cowl top cover. Refer to EI-20, COWL TOP . 4. Apply a protective tape around the windshield glass to protect the painted surface from damage.  If the windshield glass is to be reused, mark the body and the glass with mating marks. Remove the glass using piano wire or power cutting tool and an inflatable pump bag. WARNING: When cutting the glass from the vehicle, always wear safety glasses and heavy gloves to help prevent glass splinters from entering your eyes or cutting your hands. CAUTION:  Be careful not to scratch the glass when removing.  Do not set or stand glass on its edge. Small chips may develop into cracks. INSTALLATION Installation is in the reverse order of removal.  Use a genuine NISSAN Urethane Adhesive Kit (if available) or equivalent and follow the instructions furnished with it. Primer 9. Instrument panel REAR WINDOW GLASS AND MOLDING LIIA1243E REAR WINDOW GLASS AND MOLDING Removal and Installation Remove glass using piano wire or power cutting tool and an inflatable pump bag. If the rear window glass is to be reused, mark the body and the glass with mating marks. WARNING: When cutting the glass from the vehicle, always wear safety glasses and heavy gloves to help prevent glass splinters from entering your eyes or cutting your hands. CAUTION:  When the rear window glass is to be reused, do not use a cutting knife or power cutting tool.   Be careful not to scratch the glass when removing.  Do not set or stand the glass on its edge. Small chips may develop into cracks.  INSTALLATION Installation is in the reverse order of removal.  Use a genuine NISSAN Urethane Adhesive Kit (if available) or equivalent and follow the instructions furnished with it.  While the urethane adhesive is curing, open a door window. This will prevent the glass from being forced out by passenger compartment air pressure when a door is closed.  The molding must be installed securely so that it is in position and leaves no gap.  Check gap along bottom to confirm that glass does not contact sheet metal.  Inform the customer that the vehicle should remain stationary until the urethane adhesive has completely cured (preferably 24 hours). Curing time varies with temperature and humidity. WARNING:  Keep heat and open flames away as primers and adhesive are flammable.  The materials contained in the kit are harmful if swallowed, and may irritate skin and eyes. Avoid contact with the skin and eyes.  Use in an open, well ventilated location. Avoid breathing the vapors. They can be harmful if inhaled. If affected by vapor inhalation, immediately move to an area with fresh air.  Driving the vehicle before the urethane adhesive has completely cured may affect the performance of the rear window in case of an accident. CAUTION:  Do not use an adhesive which is past its usable term. Shelf life of this product is limited to six months after the date of manufacture. Carefully adhere to the expiration or manufacture date printed on the box.  Keep primers and adhesive in a cool, dry place. Ideally, they should be stored in a refrigerator.  Do not leave primers or adhesive cartridge unattended with their caps open or off.  The vehicle should not be driven for at least 24 hours or until the urethane adhesive has completely cured. Curing time varies depending on temperature and humidity. The curing time will increase under lower temperatures and lower humidities. Repairing Water Leaks for Rear Window Glass Leaks can be repaired without removing or reinstalling glass. If water is leaking between urethane adhesive material and body or glass, determine the extent of leakage. This can be done by applying water to the rear window area while pushing glass outward. To stop leak, apply primer (if necessary) and then urethane adhesive to the leak point.

Daytime light lamps are not turned on if engine is activated with parking brake on. Take off parking brake to turn on daytime light lamps. The lamps turn off when lighting switch is in the 2ND position or AUTO position (Headlamp is ON ) and when lighting switch is in the PASSING position. (Daytime light lamps are not turned off only by parking brake itself.) A parking brake signal and engine run or stop signal are sent to BCM (body control module) by CAN communication line. LT-27 High Beam Operation/Flash-to-Pass Operation A With the lighting switch in 2ND position and placed in HIGH or PASS position, the BCM receives input requesting the headlamp high beams to illuminate. This input is communicated to the IPDM E/R across the CAN communication lines. The CPU of the combination meter controls the ON/OFF status of the HIGH BEAM indicator. B The CPU of the IPDM E/R controls the headlamp high relay coil. When energized, this relay directs power  through 10A fuse (No. 34, located in the IPDM E/R)  through IPDM E/R terminal 56  to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 1, and  through 10A fuse (No. 35, located in the IPDM E/R)  through IPDM E/R terminal 55  to front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 1. Ground is supplied  to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 2, and to daytime light relay 1 terminal 4, and  to daytime light relay 2 terminal 1  through grounds E9, E15 (all) and E24 (VQ40DE engine only). When the CPU of the IPDM E/R energizes the headlamp high relay, it de-energizes daytime relay 1. When deenergized, this relay supplies ground  to front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 2  through daytime light relay 1 terminal 3. With power and ground supplied, the high beam headlamps illuminate. DAYTIME LIGHT OPERATION With the engine running, the lighting switch in the OFF or 1ST position and parking brake released, the IPDM E/R receives input requesting the daytime lights illuminate. This input is communicated across the CAN communication lines. The CPU of the IPDM E/R controls daytime light relay 1 which supplies ground  to daytime light relay 1 terminal 1  through IPDM E/R terminal 44. When energized, daytime light relay 1 directs power  through daytime light relay 1 terminal 3  through front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 2  through front combination lamp LH (headlamp) terminal 1  through IPDM E/R terminal 55   through 10A fuse (No. 35, located in the IPDM E/R)  through 10A fuse (No. 34, located in the IPDM E/R)  through IPDM E/R terminal 56  to front combination lamp RH (headlamp) terminal 1.

EKS00CMN Control of the fog lamps is dependent upon the position of the combination switch (lighting switch). The lighting switch must be in the 2ND position or AUTO position (LOW beam is ON) for front fog lamp operation. When the lighting switch is placed in the fog lamp position, the BCM (body control module) receives input signal requesting the fog lamps to illuminate. When the headlamps are illuminated, this input signal is communicated to the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room) across the CAN communication lines. The CPU (central processing unit) of the IPDM E/R controls the front fog lamp relay coil. When activated, this relay directs power to the front fog lamps. OUTLINE Power is supplied at all times  to front fog lamp relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and  to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and  through 20A fuse (No. 53, located in the IPDM E/R)  to CPU of the IPDM E/R, and  through 50A fusible link (letter g, located in the fuse and fusible link box) to BCM terminal 70. When the ignition switch is in ON or START position, power is supplied to ignition relay, located in the IPDM E/R, and through 10A fuse [No. 1, located in the fuse block (J/B)] to BCM terminal 38. Ground is supplied  to BCM terminal 67  through grounds M57, M61 and M79, and  to IPDM E/R terminals 38 and 59  through grounds E9, E15 and E24. FOG LAMP OPERATION The fog lamp switch is built into the combination switch. The lighting switch must be in the 2ND position or AUTO position (LOW beam is ON) and the fog lamp switch must be ON for fog lamp operation. With the fog lamp switch in the ON position, the CPU of the IPDM E/R grounds the coil side of the fog lamp relay. The fog lamp relay then directs power M18, M20 (view with lower instrument panel LH removed)  through 20A fuse (No. 56, located in the IPDM E/R)  through IPDM E/R terminal 50 to front fog lamp LH terminal 1, and  through IPDM E/R terminal 51  to front fog lamp RH terminal 1. Ground is supplied  to front fog lamp LH and RH terminal 2 through grounds E9, E15 and E24. With power and ground supplied, the front fog lamps illuminate. COMBINATION SWITCH READING FUNCTION Refer to BCS-3, COMBINATION SWITCH READING FUNCTION . EXTERIOR LAMP BATTERY SAVER CONTROL When the combination switch (lighting switch) is in the 2ND position (ON), the fog lamp switch is ON, and the ignition switch is turned from ON or ACC to OFF, the battery saver control feature is activated. F Under this condition, the fog lamps (and headlamps) remain illuminated for 5 minutes, then the fog lamps (and headlamps) are turned off.

WBIA0567E PRECAUTIONS Precautions for Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER EBS00YSG C LU The Supplemental Restraint System such as AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER , used along with a front seat belt, helps to reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger for certain types of collision. This system includes seat belt switch inputs and dual stage front air bag modules. The SRS system uses the seat belt switches to determine the front air bag deployment, and may only deploy one front air bag, depending on the severity of a collision and whether the front occupants are belted or unbelted. Information necessary to service the system safely is included in the SRS and SB section of this Service Manual. WARNING:  To avoid rendering the SRS inoperative, which could increase the risk of personal injury or death in the event of a collision which would result in air bag inflation, all maintenance must be performed by an authorized NISSAN/INFINITI dealer.  Improper maintenance, including incorrect removal and installation of the SRS, can lead to personal injury caused by unintentional activation of the system. For removal of Spiral Cable and Air Bag Module, see the SRS section.  Do not use electrical test equipment on any circuit related to the SRS unless instructed to in this Service Manual. SRS wiring harnesses can be identified by yellow and/or orange harnesses or harness connectors. Precautions for Liquid Gasket LIQUID GASKET APPLICATION PROCEDURE EBS00YSH 1.

When shift lever assembly is shifted to 1st, 2nd side and 5th, 6th side, confirm shift lever assembly returns to neutral position smoothly.  In any position other than reverse, confirm that shift lever assembly can be pressed downward.  With shift lever assembly pressed downward, confirm that it can be shifted to reverse.  When shifted from reverse to neutral position, confirm shift lever assembly returns to neutral position smoothly with spring power.  Without shift lever assembly pressed downward, confirm that it cannot be shifted to reverse.

"1 Removal and Installation for Low-pressure Flexible  A/C Hose.............................................................. 107 MTC-3 Precautions for Refrigerant Connection EJS003OG A new type refrigerant connection has been introduced to all refrigerant lines except the following locations.  Expansion valve to cooling unit Evaporator pipes to evaporator (inside cooling unit)    Refrigerant pressure sensor FEATURES OF NEW TYPE REFRIGERANT CONNECTION  The O-ring has been relocated. It has also been provided with a groove for proper installation. This reduces the possibility of the O-ring being caught in, or damaged by, the mating part. The sealing direction of the O-ring is now set vertically in relation to the contacting surface of the mating part to improve sealing characteristics.  The reaction force of the O-ring will not occur in the direction that causes the joint to pull out, thereby facilitating piping connections. SHA815E O-RING AND REFRIGERANT CONNECTION A/C Compressor and Condenser 3. High-pressure A/C pipe 6. Compressor shaft seal 9. Low-pressure service valve 2. Clip 5. Condenser 8. Low-pressure flexible A/C hose 11. Expansion valve 12. A/C drain hose *: Always check with the Parts Department for the latest parts information. WARNING: Make sure all refrigerant is discharged into the recycling equipment and the pressure in the system is less than atmospheric pressure. Then gradually loosen the discharge side hose fitting and remove it. CAUTION: When replacing or cleaning refrigerant cycle components, observe the following. When the compressor is removed, store it in the same position as it is when mounted on the car. Failure to do so will cause oil to enter the low pressure chamber.  When connecting tubes, always use a torque wrench and a back-up wrench.  After disconnecting tubes, immediately plug all openings to prevent entry of dirt and moisture. When installing an air conditioner in the vehicle, connect the pipes as the final stage of the operation. Do not remove the seal caps of pipes and other components until just before required for connection.  Allow components stored in cool areas to warm to working area temperature before removing seal caps. This prevents condensation from forming inside A/C components.  Thoroughly remove moisture from the refrigeration system before charging the refrigerant. Always replace used O-rings.  When connecting tube, apply oil to circle of the O-rings shown in illustration. Be careful not to apply oil to threaded portion. Oil name: Genuine NISSAN A/C System Oil Type R or equivalent.  O-ring must be closely attached to dented portion of tube.  When replacing the O-ring, be careful not to damage O-ring and tube.  Connect tube until you hear it click, then tighten the nut or bolt by hand until snug. Make sure that the O-ring is installed to tube correctly. 1. High-pressure service valve 4. Refrigerant pressure sensor 7. High-pressure flexible A/C hose 10. Low-pressure A/C pipe CAUTION: The new and former refrigerant connections use different O-ring configurations. Do not confuse Orings since they are not interchangeable. If a wrong O-ring is installed, refrigerant will leak at or around the connection. O-Ring Part Numbers and Specifications Connec- tion type  After connecting line, conduct leak test and make sure that there is no leakage from connections. When the refrigerant leaking point is found, disconnect that line and replace the O-ring. Then tighten connections of seal seat to the specified torque. RHA861F Precautions for Servicing Compressor EJS003OH  Plug all openings to prevent moisture and foreign matter from entering. When the compressor is removed, store it in the same position as it is when mounted on the car.  When replacing or repairing compressor, follow Maintenance of Oil Quantity in Compressor exactly. Refer to MTC-19, Maintenance of Oil Quantity in Compressor .  Keep friction surfaces between clutch and pulley clean. If the surface is contaminated with oil, wipe it off by using a clean waste cloth moistened with thinner. MTC After compressor service operation, turn the compressor shaft by hand more than 5 turns in both directions. This will equally distribute oil inside the compressor. After the compressor is installed, let the engine idle and operate the compressor for 1 hour.  After replacing the compressor magnet clutch, apply voltage to the new one and check for normal operation. Refer to MTC-104, Removal and Installation for Compressor Clutch . Precautions for Service Equipment RECOVERY/RECYCLING EQUIPMENT EJS003OI M Follow the manufacturer s instructions for machine operation and machine maintenance. Never introduce any refrigerant other than that specified into the machine. ELECTRONIC LEAK DETECTOR Follow the manufacturer s instructions for tester operation and tester maintenance. MANIFOLD GAUGE SET Be certain that the gauge face indicates HFC-134a (R-134a). Make sure the gauge set has 1/2 -16 ACME threaded connections for service hoses. Confirm the set has been used only with refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a) along with specified oil. RHA270D RHA272D SHA533D"
"2 VACUUM PUMP The oil contained inside the vacuum pump is not compatible with the specified oil for HFC-134a (R-134a) A/C systems. The vent side of the vacuum pump is exposed to atmospheric pressure so the vacuum pump oil may migrate out of the pump into the service hose. This is possible when the pump is switched off after evacuation (vacuuming) and hose is connected to it. To prevent this migration, use a manual valve situated near the hose-to-pump connection, as follows.  Usually vacuum pumps have a manual isolator valve as part of the pump. Close this valve to isolate the service hose from the pump.  For pumps without an isolator, use a hose equipped with a manual shut-off valve near the pump end. Close the valve to isolate the hose from the pump.  If the hose has an automatic shut off valve, disconnect the hose from the pump: as long as the hose is connected, the valve is open and lubricating oil may migrate. Some one-way valves open when vacuum is applied and close under a no vacuum condition. Such valves may restrict the pump s ability to pull a deep vacuum and are not recommended. SERVICE COUPLERS Never attempt to connect HFC-134a (R-134a) service couplers to a CFC-12 (R-12) A/C system. The HFC-134a (R-134a) couplers will not properly connect to the CFC-12 (R-12) system. If an improper connection is attempted, discharging and contamination may occur. RHA274D RHA273D REFRIGERANT WEIGHT SCALE Verify that no refrigerant other than HFC134a (R-134a) and specified oils have been used with the scale. If the scale controls refrigerant flow electronically, the hose fitting must be 1/2 -16 ACME. CHARGING CYLINDER Using a charging cylinder is not recommended. Refrigerant may be vented into air from cylinder s top valve when filling the cylinder with refrigerant. Also, the accuracy of the cylinder is generally less than that of an electronic scale or of quality recycle/recharge equipment. Never mix HFC-134a (R-134a) refrigerant and/or the specified oil with CFC-12 (R-12) refrigerant and/or the oil. Separate and non-interchangeable service equipment must be used for handling each type of refrigerant/oil. Refrigerant container fittings, service hose fittings and service equipment fittings (equipment which handles refrigerant and/or oil) are different between CFC-12 (R-12) and HFC-134a (R-134a). This is to avoid mixed use of the refrigerants/oil. Adapters that convert one size fitting to another must never be used refrigerant/oil contamination will occur and compressor malfunction will result. MTC-12 Commercial Service Tools Tool name (J-41810-NI) Refrigerant identifier equipment (R- 134a) REFRIGERANT FLOW The refrigerant flows in the standard pattern. Refrigerant flows through the compressor, condenser, liquid tank, expansion valve, evaporator, and back to the compressor. The refrigerant evaporation through the evaporator coil is controlled by an externally equalized expansion valve, located inside the evaporator case. FREEZE PROTECTION The compressor cycles on and off to maintain the evaporator temperature within a specified range. When the evaporator coil temperature falls below a specified point, the intake sensor interrupts the compressor operation. When the evaporator coil temperature rises above the specification, the intake sensor allows compressor operation. Refrigerant System Protection REFRIGERANT PRESSURE SENSOR EJS003OO The refrigerant system is protected against excessively high-or low-pressures by the refrigerant pressure sensor, located on the condenser. If the system pressure rises above or falls below the specifications, the refrigerant pressure sensor detects the pressure inside the refrigerant line and sends a voltage signal to the ECM. The ECM de-energizes the A/C relay to disengage the magnetic compressor clutch when pressure on the high pressure side detected by refrigerant pressure sensor is over about 2,746 kPa (28 kg/cm$^{2}$, 398 psi), or below about 120 kPa (1.22 kg/cm$^{2}$, 17.4 psi). PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE The refrigerant system is also protected by a pressure relief valve, located in the rear head of the compressor. When the pressure of refrigerant in the system increases to an abnormal level [more than 2,990 kPa (30.5 kg/ cm$^{2}$, 433.6 psi)], the release port on the pressure relief valve automatically opens and releases refrigerant into the atmosphere.

Measure an amount of new oil installed equal to amount drained from old compressor. Add this oil to new compressor through the suction port opening. 8. Measure an amount of new oil equal to the amount recovered during discharging. Add this oil to new compressor through the suction port opening. 9. If the liquid tank also needs to be replaced, add an additional 5 m (0.2 US fl oz, 0.2 Imp fl oz) of oil at this time. When the A/C switch is pressed, or the mode switch is turned to the defroster position, the front air control outputs a compressor ON signal to BCM. The BCM then sends a compressor ON signal to ECM, via CAN communication line."

"1 SQUEAK AND RATTLE TROUBLE DIAGNOSES Work Flow CUSTOMER INTERVIEW Interview the customer if possible, to determine the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer to RF-8, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs.  The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur).  If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer.   After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise.  Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.  Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor)   Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity. Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance.  Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action.  Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions.  Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity. Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact.  Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person. A noise that you may judge as acceptable may be very irritating to the customer. Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature, may have a great effect on noise level.

SDIA2236E SELECTION ADJUSTING WASHERS Side Gear Back Clearance  Assemble the differential parts if they are disassembled. Refer to RFD-63, Differential Assembly . 1. Place the differential case straight up so that the side gear to be measured is upward. Drive Pinion Height Adjusting Washer  Drive gear and drive pinion are supplied in matched sets only. Matching numbers on both drive pinion and drive gear are etched for verification. If a new gear set is being used, verify the numbers of each drive pinion and drive gear before proceeding with assembly. SDIA2241E E F G H The mounting distance from the center line of drive gear to the back face of drive pinion for the Model drive assembly is 109.5 mm (4.312 in). On the button end of each drive pinion, there is etched a plus (+) number, a minus (-) number, or a zero (0), which indicates the best running position for each particular gear set. This dimension is controlled by a selective drive pinion height adjusting washer between drive pinion inner bearing race and drive pinion. For example: If a drive pinion is etched m+8 (+3), it would require 0.08 mm (0.003 in) less drive pinion height adjusting washer than a drive pinion etched 0 . This means decreasing drive pinion height adjusting washer thickness; increases the mounting distance of drive pinion to 109.6 mm (4.315 in). If a drive pinion is etched m-8 (-3), it would require adding 0.08 mm (0.003 in) more to drive pinion height adjusting washer than would be required if drive pinion were etched 0 . By adding 0.08 mm (0.003 in), the mounting distance of drive pinion was decreased to 109.4 mm (4.309 in) which is just what m-8 (a-3) etching indicated.  To change drive pinion adjustment, use different drive pinion height adjusting washers which come in different thickness.  Use the following tables as a guide for selecting the correct drive pinion height adjusting washer thickness to add or subtract from the old drive pinion height adjusting washer. 4. Turn the assembly several times to seat drive pinion bearings. PDIA0320E 3. Install drive pinion bearing inner race and drive pinion height adjusting washer to gear carrier using Tool as shown. 6.

How to Perform Trouble Diagnosis BASIC CONCEPT EDS0027J  To perform trouble diagnosis, it is most important to have understanding about the vehicle systems (control and mechanism) thoroughly.  It is also important to clarify customer complaints before inspection. First of all, reproduce symptoms, and understand them fully. Ask customer about his/her complaints carefully. In some cases, it will be necessary to check symptoms by driving vehicle with customer. CAUTION: Customers are not professional. It is dangerous to make an easy guess like maybe the customer means that..., or maybe the customer mentions this symptom ."
"12  It is essential to check symptoms right from the beginning in order to repair malfunctions completely. For intermittent malfunctions, reproduce symptoms based on interview with customer and past examples. Do not perform inspection on ad hoc basis. Most intermittent malfunctions are caused by poor contacts. In this case, it will be effective to shake suspected harness or connector by hand. When repairing without any symptom diagnosis, you cannot judge if malfunctions have actually been eliminated.  After completing diagnosis, always erase diagnostic memory. Refer to RFD-89, How to Erase Self-diagnostic Results .  For intermittent malfunctions, move harness or harness connector by hand. Then check for poor contact or reproduced open circuit.

Remove drive pinion rear bearing inner race and drive pinion height adjusting washer using Tool.  SDIA2236E SELECTION ADJUSTING WASHERS Drive Pinion Height Adjusting Washer  Drive gear and drive pinion are supplied in matched sets only. Matching numbers on both drive pinion and drive gear are etched for verification. If a new gear set is being used, verify the numbers of each drive pinion and drive gear before proceeding with assembly. SDIA2241E  The mounting distance from the center line of drive gear to the back face of drive pinion for the Model 22 drive assembly is 109.5 mm (4.312 in). On the button end of each drive pinion, there is etched a plus (+) number, a minus (-) number, or a zero (0), which indicates the best running position for each particular gear set. This dimension is controlled by a selective drive pinion height adjusting washer between drive pinion inner bearing race and drive pinion. For example: If a drive pinion is etched m+8 (+3), it would require 0.08 mm (0.003 in) less drive pinion height adjusting washer than a drive pinion etched 0 . This means decreasing drive pinion height adjusting washer thickness; increases the mounting distance of drive pinion to 109.6 mm (4.315 in). If a drive pinion is etched m-8 (-3), it would require adding 0.08 mm (0.003 in) more to drive pinion height adjusting washer than would be required if drive pinion were etched 0 . By adding 0.08 mm (0.003 in), the mounting distance of drive pinion was decreased to 109.4 mm (4.309 in) which is just what m-8 (a-3) etching indicated.  To change drive pinion adjustment, use different drive pinion height adjusting washers which come in different thickness.  Use the following tables as a guide for selecting the correct drive pinion height adjusting washer thickness to add or subtract from the old drive pinion height adjusting washer. 4.

Transmission housing Starter cover CHARGING SYSTEM PFP:23100 System Description EKS00D6K The generator provides DC voltage to operate the vehicle s electrical system and to keep the battery charged. The voltage output is controlled by the IC regulator. Power is supplied at all times to generator terminal 3 through  15A fuse (No. 30, located in the fuse and fusible link box). C D Terminal 1 supplies power to charge the battery and operate the vehicle s electrical system. Output voltage is controlled by the IC regulator at terminal 3 detecting the input voltage. A pulse width modulated (PWM) signal is sent from terminal 37 of the IPDM E/R to terminal 4 of the generator. The ECM determines the duty cycle of the power generation variable voltage control system. The charging circuit is protected by the 140A fusible link [letter a, located in the fusible link box (battery)]. The generator is grounded through the engine. With the ignition switch in the ON or START position, power is supplied through 10A fuse [No. 14, located in the fuse block (J/B)]    to combination meter terminal 16 for the charge warning lamp. F G Ground is supplied to terminal 2 of the combination meter through terminal 2 of the generator. With power and ground supplied, the charge warning lamp will illuminate. When the generator is providing sufficient voltage with the engine running, the ground is opened and the charge warning lamp will go off. If the charge warning lamp illuminates with the engine running, a fault is indicated. The IC regulator warning function activates to illuminate CHARGE warning lamp, if any of the following symptoms occur while generator is operating  Excessive voltage is produced.  No voltage is produced. POWER GENERATION VARIABLE VOLTAGE CONTROL SYSTEM PKIB4908E NOTE: Power generation variable voltage control system has been adopted. By varying the voltage to the generator, engine load due to power generation of the generator is reduced and fuel consumption is decreased. Operation  The battery current sensor detects the charging/discharging current of the battery. ECM judges the battery condition based on this signal.  ECM judges whether to control voltage according to the battery condition.  ECM calculates the target power generation voltage according to the battery condition and sends the calculated value, through CAN lines, as the power generation command value to IPDM E/R.  IPDM E/R converts the received power generation command value into the power generation command signal (PWM signal) and sends it to the IC regulator. The IC regulator performs final control over the power generation voltage.   BBIA0630E  When there is no power generation command signal, the generator performs the normal power generation according to the characteristic of the IC regulator. NOTE: When any malfunction is detected in the power generation variable voltage control system, power generation is performed according to the characteristic of the IC regulator in the generator. Component Battery current sensor is installed to the negative battery cable and it detects the charging/discharging current of the battery and sends the voltage signal to ECM according to the current value.

The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise.  Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces = higher pitch noise/softer surfaces = lower pitch noises/edge to surface = chirping.  Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor)   Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity.  Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance.  Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action.  Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions.  Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity.  Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact.  Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person. A noise that you may judge as acceptable may be very irritating to the customer.  Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature, may have a great effect on noise level.

"1 The air bag deploys if the air bag diagnosis sensor unit is activated while the ignition switch is in the ON or START position. The collision modes for which supplemental restraint systems are activated are different among the SRS systems. For example, the driver air bag module, front passenger air bag module and front seat belt pre-tensioners are activated in a frontal collision but not in a side collision. SRS configurations for some collision modes are as follows: SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) SRS Configuration Front Passenger Air Bag Module The front passenger air bag module is located behind the instrument panel assembly. It operates with the SRS system in a frontal collision exceeding a specified level. Refer to SRS-7, Occupant Classification System (OCS) for more information. WHIA0332E EHS001BJ WHIA0325E EHS0025R WHIA0327E EHS001BK WHIA0041E Front Side Air Bag Front side air bag modules are built into the front seatback assemblies. Vehicles with side air bags are equipped with labels as shown. Side Curtain Air Bag Side curtain air bag modules are located above the vehicle headlining. Vehicles with side curtain air bags are equipped with labels as shown. Passenger does not meet Occupant Classification System specifications for passenger air bag activation. Front Seat Belt Pre-tensioner with Load Limiter The seat belt pre-tensioner system with load limiter is installed for both the driver s seat and the front passenger s seat. It operates simultaneously with the SRS air bag system in the event of a frontal collision with an impact exceeding a specified level. When the frontal collision with an impact exceeding a specified level occurs, seat belt slack resulting from clothing or other factors is immediately taken up by the pre-tensioner. Vehicle passengers are securely restrained. When passengers in a vehicle are thrown forward in a collision and the restraining force of the seat belt exceeds a specified level, the load limiter permits the specified extension of the seat belt by the twisting of the ELR shaft, and a relaxation of the chest-area seat belt web tension while maintaining force. Occupant Classification System (OCS)  EHS001SB F G The occupant classification system (OCS) identifies different size occupants, out of position occupants, and detects if child seat is present in the front passenger seat. The OCS receives inputs from the occupant classification sensor (located inside the passenger seat cushion assembly) and belt tension sensor (part of the passenger front seat belt assembly and located at the belt anchor location). Depending on classification of the passenger, the OCS sends a signal to the air bag diagnosis sensor unit. The air bag diagnosis sensor unit uses this signal and the seat belt buckle switch RH signal to determine deployment or non deployment of the passenger front air bag in the event of a collision. Depending on the signals received, the air bag diagnosis sensor unit can disable the passenger front air bag completely. NOTE: In case of customer concern, CONSULT-II can be used to confirm the passenger air bag status (readiness). Passenger Air Bag Status Conditions Direct-connect SRS Component Connectors The following SRS components use direct-connect style harness connectors.  Driver air bag module  Front passenger air bag module  LH side curtain air bag module  RH side curtain air bag module  Front LH seat belt pre-tensioner  Front RH seat belt pre-tensioner Always pull up to release locking tab prior to removing connector from SRS component.

TRANSFER CONTROL UNIT  Transfer control unit controls transfer control device by input signals of each sensor and each switch, and it directs shifts from 4H 4LO and 2WD 4WD.  Self-diagnosis can be done. TRANSFER SHIFT HIGH AND LOW RELAYS Transfer shift high and low relays apply power supply to transfer control device (actuator motor). TRANSFER SHUT OFF RELAYS Transfer shut off relays 1 and 2 apply power supply to transfer control unit. SDIA2213E EDS002PA ATP WARNING LAMP (A/T MODELS) K When A/T selector lever is in P position, vehicle may move because A/T parking mechanism does not operate when transfer is under neutral condition. ATP warning lamp is turned on to indicate this condition to the driver. TF-17 TF-18 EDS002PB System Diagram EDS002PD SEF234G TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS How to Perform Trouble Diagnosis BASIC CONCEPT  To perform trouble diagnosis, it is important to have understanding about vehicle systems (control and mechanism).  It is also important to clarify customer complaints before inspection. First of all, reproduce symptoms, and understand them fully. Ask customer about his/her complaints carefully. In some cases, it will be necessary to check symptoms by driving vehicle with customer. CAUTION: Customers are not professional. It is dangerous to make an easy guess like maybe the customer means that..., or maybe the customer mentions this symptom . SEF233G It is essential to check symptoms right from the beginning in order to repair malfunctions completely. For intermittent malfunctions, reproduce symptoms based on interview with customer and past examples. Do not perform inspection on ad hoc basis. Most intermittent malfunctions are caused by poor contacts. In this case, it will be effective to shake suspected harness or connector by hand. When repairing without any symptom diagnosis, you cannot judge if malfunctions have actually been eliminated.  After completing diagnosis, always erase diagnostic memory. Refer to TF-50, ERASE SELF-DIAGNOSIS .  For intermittent malfunctions, move harness or harness connector by hand. Then check for poor contact or reproduced open circuit.

The spark is created at the two cylinders at TDC by cutting the earth to the coil concerned. THE COILS There are two coils. They are of with dual monoblock output (they cannot be separated). They are controlled separately by the computer. They create two sparks simultaneously. Both coils are connected to an interference suppressor.

"10 The accelerator pedal potentiometer is connected to the pedal by a linkage. There are two types of pedal: with or without point of  resistance. Vehicles with cruise control/speed limiter have an accelerator pedal with a point of resistance at the end of their travel (kickdown) This point of resistance makes it possible to exit the speed limiter function if the driver has to increase vehicle speed. IMPORTANT : it is permitted to fit a potentiometer with a point of resistance in place of a potentiometer without a point of resistance. However, it is forbidden to fit a potentiometer without a point of resistance in place of a potentiometer with a point of resistance. 1 Track 2 earth 2 Track 1 earth 3 Track 1 signal 4 Track 1 feed 5 Track 2 feed 6 Track 2 signal Motorised throttle valve MOTORISED THROTTLE VALVE The motorised throttle valve is used to regulate the idle speed and control the air intake and therefore engine torque requirements through the torque sequence calculation (air/advance). It consists of an electric motor supplied with 12 volts through an OCR control (opening cyclic ratio) and two inverse information throttle potentiometers (one track increases whilst the other decreases).   When the engine is idling, the throttle position is adjusted according to the idle speed setting. This setting takes into account the resistant forces of the engine, high consumers (air conditioning) and the engine s operating conditions (air and coolant temperature). When the driver presses the accelerator pedal, the request is translated into a throttle opening angle. However, to improve driving pleasure, the throttle opening is not directly proportional to the driver s request.   To eliminate misfires, facilitate gear changes and perform the safety functions, the throttle valve modulates the engine torque. Injection/air conditioning programming THE COMPRESSOR IS OF VARIABLE DISPLACEMENT TYPE There is no air conditioning computer on this type of engine. The injection computer directly controls the compressor clutch, taking into account the power absorbed by the compressor and the pressure of the refrigerant in the circuit. The following computer tracks are used for the air conditioning function:-one wire on track A A4. This wire conveys information authorising or forbidding operation of the compressor,-one wire on track A D2 on which the air conditioning cycling information is conveyed,-one wire on track A C1 and A K2 for the refrigerant pressure sensor supply,-one wire on track A J1 for the pressure sensor information. When the air conditioning is switched on, the injection computer authorises the compressor clutch according to the various parameters and adopts a fast idling speed. This engine speed may reach 850 rpm (D4F engine) or 950 rpm (D4D engine) depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and the pressure of the refrigerant. Output conditions -Full load not recognised-or 7 second timed period expired-or engine speed greater than or equal to 2512 rpm-or vehicle speed greater than 62 km/h (Clio) and 72 km/h (Kangoo) In order for the OBD (On Board Diagnostic) system to function correctly, there must be no electrical faults in the injection system, even if the OBD warning light is not illuminated. Fault finding of the upstream oxygen sensor and the catalytic converter can never be performed at the same time. The aim of catalytic converter diagnostics is to detect a problem which would cause the OBD On board diagnostic limit to be exceeded by HC pollutant emissions. The ability of the catalytic converter to store oxygen indicates its condition. As the catalytic converter ages, its ability to store oxygen reduces along with its ability to treat pollutant gases. GENERAL INFORMATION Cruise control : allows the driver maintain a selected speed. This function can be deactivated at any moment by pressing the brake pedal (or the clutch pedal with a manual gearbox), or by using one of the system buttons. Speed limiter : allows the driver to set a speed limit. The accelerator pedal will not function above the set speed. The speed limit selected can be exceeded at any time by pressing the accelerator pedal beyond its point of resistance. A warning light on the instrument panel informs the driver of the status of the cruise control/speed limiter:-Green light: cruise control in operation, -Amber light: speed limiter in operation, -Speed setting flashing: the set speed cannot be maintained (e.g. going downhill). To control these functions, the injection computer receives the following signals on the following tracks:-A B3 : Brake switch closing (stop lights) -A C3 : Brake switch opening (safety)-A F3 : Cruise control button-A G2 : Cruise control / speed limiter control earth -A G3 : Clutch switch -A G4 : Speed limiter control button -A J2 : Cruise control / speed limiter control signal REFITTING Replace the exhaust downpipe seal.

"1 Precautions Before connecting or disconnecting the TCM harness connector, turn ignition switch OFF and disconnect negative battery terminal. Failure to do so may damage the TCM. Because battery voltage is applied to TCM even if ignition switch is turned off.   Before replacing TCM, perform TCM input/output signal inspection and make sure whether TCM functions properly or not. (See page AT-64, TCM Terminals and Reference Value .) After performing each TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS, perform DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) Confirmation Procedure . The DTC should not be displayed in the DTC Confirmation Procedure if the repair is completed. Before proceeding with disassembly, thoroughly clean the outside of the transaxle. It is important to prevent the internal parts from becoming contaminated by dirt or other foreign matter. Disassembly should be done in a clean work area. Use lint-free cloth or towels for wiping parts clean. Common shop rags can leave fibers that could interfere with the operation of the transaxle.  Place disassembled parts in order for easier and proper assembly. All parts should be carefully cleaned with a general purpose, non-flammable solvent before inspection or reassembly.   Gaskets, seals and O-rings should be replaced any time the transaxle is disassembled. It is very important to perform functional tests whenever they are indicated. The valve body contains precision parts and requires extreme care when parts are removed and serviced. Place disassembled valve body parts in order for easier and proper assembly. Care will also prevent springs and small parts from becoming scattered or lost.  Properly installed valves, sleeves, plugs, etc. will slide along bores in valve body under their own weight. Before assembly, apply a coat of recommended ATF to all parts. Apply petroleum jelly to protect O-rings and seals, or hold bearings and washers in place during assembly. Do not use grease.   Extreme care should be taken to avoid damage to O-rings, seals and gaskets when assembling. After overhaul, refill the transaxle with new ATF. When the A/T drain plug is removed, only some of the ATF is drained. Old ATF will remain in torque converter and ATF cooling system. Always follow the procedures under Changing A/T Fluid in the AT section when changing A/T fluid. Refer to Changing A/T Fluid , AT-14, Checking A/T Fluid .

AT-27 DURING SHIFT CHANGE The line pressure is temporarily reduced corresponding to a change in engine torque when shifting gears (that is, when the shift solenoid valve is switched for clutch operation) to reduce shifting shock. AT-28 BCS000ZS SCIA4827E Line Pressure Control TCM has various line pressure control characteristics to match the driving conditions.   An ON-OFF duty signal is sent to the line pressure solenoid valve based on TCM characteristics. Hydraulic pressure on the clutch and brake is electronically controlled through the line pressure solenoid valve to accommodate engine torque. This results in smooth shift operation. NORMAL CONTROL The characteristics of line pressure to throttle opening. SCIA4826E SCIA4828E BACK-UP CONTROL (ENGINE BRAKE) If the selector lever is shifted to 2 position while driving in D 4, D3 or 33, great driving force is applied to the clutch inside the transmission.

"4 Line pressure is increased to a maximum irrespective of the throttle opening when A/T fluid temperature drops to-10 C (14 F). This pressure rise is adopted to prevent a delay in clutch and brake operation due to extreme drop of A/T fluid viscosity at low temperature.   SAT008J SCIA4830E Shift Control BCS000ZT The shift is regulated entirely by electronic control to accommodate vehicle speed and varying engine operations. This is accomplished by electrical signals transmitted by the revolution sensor and the ECM (accelerator pedal position sensor). This results in improved acceleration performance and fuel economy. CONTROL OF SHIFT SOLENOID VALVES A AND B The TCM activates shift solenoid valves A and B according to sig- nals from the accelerator pedal position sensor and revolution sen- sor to select the optimum gear position on the basis of the shift schedule memorized in the TCM. The shift solenoid valve performs simple ON-OFF operation. When set to ON , the drain circuit closes and pilot pressure is applied to the shift valve.

The figure above shows the operation of shift valve B. When the shift solenoid valve is ON , pilot pressure applied to the end face of the shift valve overcomes spring force, moving the valve upward. Lock-up Control BCS000ZU The torque converter clutch piston in the torque converter is locked to eliminate torque converter slip to increase power transmission efficiency. The solenoid valve is controlled by an ON-OFF duty signal sent from the TCM. The signal is converted to an oil pressure signal which controls the torque converter clutch piston. CONDITIONS FOR LOCK-UP OPERATION When vehicle is driven in 3rd and 4th gear position, vehicle speed and throttle opening are detected. If the detected values fall within the lock-up zone memorized in the TCM, lock-up is performed. SCIA5623E Gear position , D2 , D3 gear position , 32 , 33 gear position , 22 gear position , 12 gear position AT-31 Lock-up Released  In the lock-up released state, the torque converter clutch control valve is set into the unlocked state by draining the torque converter clutch piston applying pressure and the torque converter clutch piston release pressure is generated. In this way, the torque converter clutch piston is not coupled. Lock-up Applied In the lock-up applied state, the torque converter clutch control valve is set into the locked state by generating the torque converter clutch piston applying pressure and the torque converter clutch piston release pressure is drained. In this way, the torque converter clutch piston is pressed and coupled. SMOOTH LOCK-UP CONTROL  When shifting from the lock-up released state to the lock-up applied state, the current output to the torque converter clutch solenoid is controlled with the TCM. In this way, when shifting to the lock-up applied state, the torque converter clutch is temporarily set to the half-clutched state to reduce the shock. Half-clutched State F The current output from the TCM to the torque converter clutch solenoid is varied to steadily increase the torque converter clutch solenoid pressure. In this way, the lock-up applying pressure gradually rises and while the torque converter clutch piston is put into half-clutched status, the torque converter clutch piston applying pressure is increased and the coupling is completed smoothly. Engine Brake Control (Overrun Clutch Control) BCS000ZV H Forward one-way clutch is used to reduce shifting shocks in downshifting operations. This clutch transmits engine torque to the wheels. However, drive force from the wheels is not transmitted to the engine because the one-way clutch rotates idle. This means the engine brake is not effective. The overrun clutch operates when the engine brake is needed. OVERRUN CLUTCH OPERATING CONDITIONS SAT015J OVERRUN CLUTCH CONTROL VALVE OPERATION When the solenoid valve is ON , pilot pressure is applied to the overrun clutch control valve. This pushes up the overrun clutch control valve. The line pressure is then shut off so that the clutch does not engage. When the solenoid valve is OFF , pilot pressure is not generated. At this point, the overrun clutch control valve moves downward by spring force. As a result, overrun clutch operation pressure is provided by the overrun clutch reducing valve. This causes the overrun clutch to engage. In the 2 and 1 positions, the overrun clutch control valve rema pushed down so that the overrun clutch is engaged at all times. SCIA3458E OVERRUN CLUTCH SOLENOID VALVE CONTROL The overrun clutch solenoid valve is operated by an ON-OFF signal transmitted by the TCM to provide overrun clutch control (engine brake control). When this solenoid valve is ON , the pilot pressure drain port closes. When it is OFF , the drain port opens. During the solenoid valve ON pilot pressure is applied to the end face of the overrun clutch control valve."
"5 BCS000ZZ SAT632I How to Perform Trouble Diagnoses for Quick and Accurate Repair INTRODUCTION The TCM receives a signal from the vehicle speed sensor, accelerator pedal position sensor or PNP switch and provides shift control or lock-up control via A/T solenoid valves. Input and output signals must always be correct and stable in the operation of the A/T system. The A/T system must be in good operating condition and be free of valve seizure, solenoid valve malfunction, etc. It is much more difficult to diagnose a malfunction that occurs intermittently rather than continuously. Most intermittent malfunctions are caused by poor electric connections or improper wiring. In this case, careful checking of suspected circuits may help prevent the replacement of good parts. A visual check only, may not find the cause of the malfunctions. A road test with CONSULT-II or a circuit tester connected should be performed. Follow the AT-37, WORK FLOW . SAT631IA SEF234G Before undertaking actual checks, take a few minutes to talk with a customer who approaches with a drivability complaint. The customer can supply good information about such malfunctions, especially intermittent ones. Find out what symptoms are present and under what conditions they occur. A DIAGNOSTIC WORKSHEET like the example (AT-38, DIAGNOSTIC WORKSHEET ) should be used. Start your diagnosis by looking for conventional malfunctions first. This will help troubleshoot drivability malfunctions on an electronically controlled engine vehicle. Also check related Service bulletins for information. WORK FLOW A good understanding of the malfunction conditions can make troubleshooting faster and more accurate. In general, each customer feels differently about a malfunction. It is important to fully understand the symptoms or conditions for a customer complaint. Make good use of the two sheets provided, AT-38, Information From Customer and AT-39, Diagnostic Worksheet , to perform the best troubleshooting possible.

"19 CAN COMMUNICATION LINE Description BCS0012P B AT CAN (Controller Area Network) is a serial communication line for real time application. It is an on-vehicle multiplex communication line with high data communication speed and excellent malfunction detection ability. Many electronic control units are equipped onto a vehicle, and each control unit shares information and links with other control units during operation (not independent). In CAN communication, control units are connected with 2 communication lines (CAN-H line, CAN-L line) allowing a high rate of information transmission with less wiring. Each control unit transmits/receives data but selectively reads required data only.

"1 RJIA4383J NOTE:  Garter spring (2) cannot be removed from cage (A) of male-side piping. Indicator ring (3) remains near piping connection point, however, this is not a malfunction. (This is to check piping connection during factory assembly.) REMOVAL 1. Clean piping connection points, and insert male-side piping into female-side piping. 2. Push inserted male-side piping harder so that female-side piping flare stretches garter spring. 3. If inside diameter of garter spring becomes larger than outside diameter of female-side piping flare, garter spring seats on flare. Then, it fits in between male-side piping cage and female-side piping flare to anchor piping connection point. NOTE: When garter spring seats on flare, and fits in between male-side piping cage and female-side piping flare, it clicks. CAUTION: Female-side piping connection is thin and easy to deform. Slowly insert the male-side piping straight in axial direction.   Insert piping securely until a click is heard. After piping connection is completed, pull male-side piping by hand to make sure that connection does not come loose. NOTE: One-touch joint connection is used in points below. Low-pressure pipe 1 to low-pressure pipe 2 (O-ring size: 16)   High-pressure pipe 1 to high-pressure pipe 2 (O-ring size: 8)   FEATURES OF NEW TYPE REFRIGERANT CONNECTION The O-ring has been relocated. It has also been provided with a groove for proper installation. This eliminates the possibility of the O-ring being caught in, or damaged by, the mating part. The sealing direction of the O-ring is now set vertically in relation to the contacting surface of the mating part to improve sealing characteristics.   2. Slide disconnector in axial direction of piping, and stretch garter spring with tapered point of disconnector. 3. Slide disconnector farther so that inside diameter of garter spring becomes larger than outside diameter of female-side piping flare. Then male-side piping can be disconnected. INSTALLATION The reaction force of the O-ring will not occur in the direction that causes the joint to pull out, thereby facilitating piping connections. O-RING AND REFRIGERANT CONNECTION QR Engine SHA815E CAUTION: The new and former refrigerant connections use different O-ring configurations. Never confuse Orings since they are not interchangeable. If a wrong O-ring is installed, refrigerant may leak at the connection. O-Ring Part Numbers and Specifications SJIA1646E When replacing or cleaning refrigerant cycle components, observe the following. When the compressor is removed, store it in the same way at it is when mounted on the car. Failure to do so will cause lubricant to enter the low-pressure chamber.   C B When connecting tubes, always use a torque wrench and a back-up wrench. After disconnecting tubes, immediately plug all openings to prevent entry of dirt and moisture. When installing an air conditioner in the vehicle, connect the pipes at the final stage of the operation. Never remove the seal caps of pipes and other components until just before required for connection. Allow components stored in cool areas to warm to working area temperature before removing seal caps. This prevents condensation from forming inside A/C components. Thoroughly remove moisture from the refrigeration system before charging the refrigerant. Always replace used O-rings. E When connecting tubes, apply lubricant to circle of the O-rings shown in illustration. Be careful not to apply lubricant to threaded portion. : Nissan A/C System Oil Type S Lubricant name O-ring must be closely attached to the groove of tube. When replacing the O-ring, be careful not to damage O-ring and tube. Connect tube until a click can be heard, then tighten the nut or bolt by hand until snug. Make sure that the O-ring is installed to tube correctly. After connecting line, perform leak test and make sure that there is no leakage from connections. When the refrigerant leaking point is found, disconnect that line and replace the O-ring. Then tighten connections of seal seat to the specified torque. RHA861F Precautions for Servicing Compressor BJS000F8 Plug all openings to prevent moisture and foreign matter from entering. When the compressor is removed, store it in the same position at it is when mounted on the car.   When replacing or repairing compressor, follow Maintenance of Lubricant Quantity in Compressor exactly. Refer toATC-21, Maintenance of Lubricant Quantity in Compressor . Keep friction surfaces between clutch and pulley clean. If the surface is contaminated, with lubricant, wipe it off by using a clean waste cloth moistened with thinner. After compressor service operation, turn the compressor shaft by hand more than five turns in both directions. This will equally distribute lubricant inside the compressor. After the compressor is installed, let the engine idle and operate the compressor for one hour. MANIFOLD GAUGE SET Be certain that the gauge face indicates HFC-134a or R-134a. Be sure the gauge set has 1/2 -16 ACME threaded connections for service hoses. Confirm the set has been used only with refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a) and specified lubricants. RHA270DA SHA533D"
"2 SERVICE HOSES Be certain that the service hoses display the markings described (colored hose with black stripe). All hoses must include positive shutoff devices (either manual or automatic) near the end of the hoses opposite the manifold gauge. RHA273D RHA272D SERVICE COUPLERS Never attempt to connect HFC-134a (R-134a) service couplers to a CFC-12 (R-12) A/C system. The HFC-134a (R-134a) couplers will not properly connect to the CFC-12 (R-12) system. However, if an improper connection is attempted, discharging and contamination may occur. REFRIGERANT WEIGHT SCALE Verify that no refrigerant other than HFC-134a (R-134a) and spec i-fied lubricants have been used with the scale.

Tool name S-NT203 REFRIGERATION SYSTEM PFP:KA990 Refrigerant Cycle BJS000FF REFRIGERANT FLOW B The refrigerant flows form the compressor through the condenser with liquid tank, through the evaporator, and back to the compressor. The refrigerant evaporation in the evaporator is controlled by an externally equalized expansion valve, located inside the evaporator case. FREEZE PROTECTION To prevent evaporator frozen up, the evaporator air temperature is monitored, and the voltage signal to the unified meter and A/C amp. will make the A/C relay go OFF and stop the compressor. Refrigerant System Protection BJS000FG REFRIGERANT PRESSURE SENSOR E F The refrigerant system is protected against excessively high-or low-pressure by the refrigerant pressure sensor, located on the condenser. If the system pressure rises above, or falls below the specifications, the refrigerant pressure sensor detects the pressure inside the refrigerant line and sends the voltage signal to the ECM. ECM makes the A/C relay go OFF and stops the compressor when pressure on the high-pressure side detected by refrigerant pressure sensor is over about 2,746 kPa (27.46 bar, 28 kg/cm$^{2}$, 398 psi), or below about 134 kPa (1.34 bar, 1.4 kg/cm$^{2}$, 20 psi). PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE The refrigerant system is also protected by a pressure relief valve, located in the rear head of the compressor. When the pressure of refrigerant in the system increases to an unusual level [more than 3,727 kPa (37.27 bar, 38 kg/cm$^{2}$, 540 psi)], the release port on the pressure relief valve automatically opens and releases refrigerant into the atmosphere. RJIA1745E RJIA3234E LUBRICANT ATC SJIA0596E RJIA1747E SJIA1609E System Construction BJS000FK A small network is constructed between the unified meter and A/C amp., air mix door motors, mode door motor and intake door motor. The unified meter and A/C amp. and motors are connected by data transmission lines and motor power supply lines. The LAN network is built through the ground circuits of each door motor. Addresses, motor opening angle signals, motor stop signals and error checking messages are all transmitted through the data transmission lines connecting the unified meter and A/C amp. and each door motor. The following functions are contained in LCUs built into the air mix door motors, the mode door motor and the intake door motor. Address Motor opening angle signals Data transmission Motor stop and drive decision Opening angle sensor (PBR function) Comparison Decision (Unified meter and A/C amp. indicated value and motor opening angle comparison)"
"3 OPERATION The unified meter and A/C amp. receives data from each of the sensors. The unified meter and A/C amp. sends mode door, air mix door and intake door opening angle data to the mode door motor LCU, air mix door motor LCU and intake door motor LCU. The mode door motor, air mix door motors and intake door motor read their respective signals according to the address signal. Opening angle indication signals received from the unified meter and A/C amp. and each of the motor position sensors is compared by the LCUs in each door motor with the existing decision and opening angles. Subsequently, HOT/COLD, DEF/VENT and FRE/REC operation is selected. The new selection data is returned to the unified meter and A/C amp. TRANSMISSION DATA AND TRANSMISSION ORDER Unified meter and A/C amp. data is transmitted consecutively to each of the door motors following the form shown in figure below. Start: Initial compulsory signal is sent to each of the door motors. Address: Data sent from the unified meter and A/C amp. are selected according to data-based decisions made by the air mix door motor, mode door motor and intake door motor. If the addresses are identical, the opening angle data and error check signals are received by the door motor LCUs. The LCUs then make the appropriate error decision. If the opening angle data have no error, door control begins. H If an error exists, the received data are rejected and corrected data received. Finally, door control is based upon the corrected opening angle data. Opening Angle: Data that shows the indicated door opening angle of each door motor. Error Check: ATC In this procedure, transmitted and received data is checked for errors. Error data are then compiled. The error check prevents corrupted data from being used by the air mix door motor, the mode door motor and the intake door motor. Error data can be related to the following symptoms. Malfunction of electrical frequency   Poor electrical connections Signal leakage from transmission lines Signal level fluctuation RJIA1748E At the end of each transmission, a stop operation, in-operation, or internal malfunction message is delivered to the unified meter and A/C amp. This completes one data transmission and control cycle. AIR MIX DOOR CONTROL (AUTOMATIC TEMPERATURE CONTROL) The air mix doors are automatically controlled so that in-vehicle temperature is maintained at a predetermined value by the temperature setting, ambient temperature, in-vehicle temperature and amount of sunload. FAN SPEED CONTROL Blower speed is automatically controlled by the temperature setting, ambient temperature, in-vehicle temperature, intake temperature, amount of sunload and air mix door position. With pressing AUTO switch, the blower motor starts to gradually increase air flow volume. When engine coolant temperature is low, the blower motor operation is delayed to prevent cool air from flowing. INTAKE DOOR CONTROL The intake doors are automatically controlled by the temperature setting, ambient temperature, in-vehicle temperature, intake temperature, amount of sunload and ON/OFF operation of the compressor. MODE DOOR CONTROL The mode door is automatically controlled by the temperature setting, ambient temperature, in-vehicle temperature, intake temperature and amount of sunload. RJIA1749E When A/C switch is pressed (with FAN ON), press DEF switch, unified meter and A/C amp. transmits compressor ON signal to BCM. H I BCM sends compressor ON signal to ECM, via CAN communication. ECM judges whether compressor can be turned ON, based on each sensor status (refrigerant pressure sensor signal, throttle angle, etc.). If it judges compressor can be turned ON, it sends compressor ON signal to IPDM E/R, via CAN communication. Upon receipt of compressor ON signal from ECM, IPDM E/R turns air conditioner relay ON to operate compressor. SELF-DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM The self-diagnosis system is built into the unified meter and A/C amp. to quickly locate the cause of malfunctions. SJIA1648E Description of Control System BJS000FL The control system consists of input sensors, switches, the unified meter and A/C amp. (microcomputer) and outputs.

In-vehicle sensor Ambient sensor Sunload sensor Intake sensor Automatic Mode K L In the automatic mode, the blower motor speed control signal is calculated by the unified meter and A/C amp. based on the input from the PBR, in-vehicle sensor, sunload sensor, intake sensor and ambient sensor. The blower motor applied voltage ranges from approximately 3.5 volts (lowest speed) to 12 volts (highest speed). The control blower speed (in the range of 3.5 to 12 V), unified meter and A/C amp. supplies a gate voltage to the fan control amp. Based on this voltage, fan control amp. controls voltage supplied to the blower motor. Starting Fan Speed Control Start up from COLD SOAK Condition (Automatic mode) In a cold start up condition where the engine coolant temperature is below 56 C (133 F), the blower will not operate for a short period of time (up to 150 seconds). The exact start delay time varies depending on the ambient and engine coolant temperature. In the most extreme case (very low ambient) the blower starting delay will be 150 seconds as described above. After this delay, the blower will operate at low speed until the engine coolant temperature rises above 56 C (133 F), and then the blower speed will increase to the objective speed. Start up from usual or HOT SOAK Condition (Automatic mode) The blower will begin operation momentarily after the AUTO switch is pressed. The blower speed will gradually rise to the objective speed over a time period of 3 seconds or less (actual time depends on the objective blower speed). RJIA3262E RJIA3264E Blower Speed Compensation Sunload When the in-vehicle temperature and the set temperature are very close, the blower will be operating at low speed. The low speed will vary depending on the sunload. During conditions of low or no sunload, the blower speed is low (approx. 3.5 V).

It only allows the unified meter and A/C amp. to recognize an ambient temperature increase of 0.33 C (0.6 F) per 100 seconds. As an example, consider stopping for a few minutes after high speed driving. Although the actual ambient temperature has not changed, the temperature detected by the ambient sensor will increase. This is because the heat from the engine compartment can radiate to the front grille area, location of the ambient sensor. DIAGNOSIS PROCEDURE FOR AMBIENT SENSOR SYMPTOM: Ambient sensor circuit is open or shorted. (21 or-21 is indicated on unified meter and A/C amp. as a result of performing self-diagnosis STEP-2.)

Check voltage between sunload sensor harness connector M61 terminal 1 and ground. - Ground OK or NG >> GO TO 2. >> GO TO 4. : Approx. 5 V Sunload Sensor The sunload sensor is located on the passenger side defroster grille. It detects sunload entering through windshield by means of a photo diode. The sensor converts the sunload into a current value which is then input into the unified meter and A/C amp. BJS000GE SUNLOAD INPUT PROCESS The unified meter and A/C amp. also includes a processing circuit which averages the variations in detected sunload over a period of time. This prevents drastic swings in the ATC system operation due to small or quick variations in detected sunload. For example, consider driving along a road bordered by an occasional group of large trees. The sunload detected by the sunload sensor will vary whenever the trees obstruct the sunlight. The processing circuit averages the detected sunload over a period of time, so that the (insignificant) effect of the trees momentarily obstructing the sunlight does not cause any change in the ATC system operation. On the other hand, shortly after entering a long tunnel, the system will recognize the change in sunload, and the system will react accordingly. DIAGNOSIS PROCEDURE FOR SUNLOAD SENSOR SYMPTOM: Sunload sensor circuit is open or shorted. (25 or-25 is indicated on unified meter and A/C amp. as a result of performing self-diagnosis STEP-2.)"

Stop the engine and perform leak check again following steps 4 through 6 above. Refrigerant leaks should be checked immediately after stopping the engine. Begin with the leak detector at the compressor. The pressure on the high-pressure side will gradually drop after refrigerant circulation stops and pressure on the low-pressure side will gradually rise, as shown in the graph. Some leaks are more easily detected when pressure is high. 11. Before connecting ACR4 to vehicle, check ACR4 gauges. No refrigerant pressure should be displayed. If pressure is displayed, recover refrigerant from equipment lines. 12. Discharge A/C system using approved refrigerant recovery equipment. Repair the leaking fitting or component if necessary. 13. Evacuate and recharge A/C system and perform the leak test to confirm no refrigerant leaks. 14. Perform A/C performance test to ensure system works properly."

"1 BIS000VL PREPARATION Commercial Service Tools Tool name CUSTOMER INTERVIEW Interview the customer if possible, to determine the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. Use the Diagnostic Worksheet during the interview to document the facts and conditions when the noise occurs and any customer s comments; refer toBL-11, Diagnostic Worksheet . This information is necessary to duplicate the conditions that exist when the noise occurs. The customer may not be able to provide a detailed description or the location of the noise. Attempt to   J K L obtain all the facts and conditions that exist when the noise occurs (or does not occur). If there is more than one noise in the vehicle, be sure to diagnose and repair the noise that the customer is concerned about. This can be accomplished by test driving the vehicle with the customer. After identifying the type of noise, isolate the noise in terms of its characteristics. The noise characteristics are provided so the customer, service adviser and technician are all speaking the same language when defining the noise. Squeak-(Like tennis shoes on a clean floor) Squeak characteristics include the light contact/fast movement/brought on by road conditions/hard surfaces=higher pitch noise/softer surfaces=lower pitch noises/edge to surface=chirping Creak-(Like walking on an old wooden floor) Creak characteristics include firm contact/slow movement/twisting with a rotational movement/pitch dependent on materials/often brought on by activity. Rattle-(Like shaking a baby rattle) Rattle characteristics include the fast repeated contact/vibration or similar movement/loose parts/missing clip or fastener/incorrect clearance. Knock-(Like a knock on a door) Knock characteristics include hollow sounding/sometimes repeating/often brought on by driver action. Tick-(Like a clock second hand) Tick characteristics include gentle contacting of light materials/loose components/can be caused by driver action or road conditions. Thump-(Heavy, muffled knock noise) Thump characteristics include softer knock/dead sound often brought on by activity. Buzz-(Like a bumble bee) Buzz characteristics include high frequency rattle/firm contact. Often the degree of acceptable noise level will vary depending upon the person. A noise that you may judge as acceptable may be very irritating to the customer. Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature, may have a great effect on noise level.

SBR820BA BFS000CO Functions ABS The Anti-Lock Brake System is a function that detects wheel revolution while braking, and it improves handling stability during sudden braking by electrically preventing 4 wheel lock. Maneuverability is also improved for avoiding obstacles.  If the electrical system breaks down, then the fail-safe function is activated, ABS becomes inoperative, and ABS warning lamp turns on. Electrical system diagnosis by CONSULT-II is available. During ABS operation, brake pedal lightly vibrates and a mechanical noise may be heard. This is normal. Just after starting vehicle after ignition switch ON, brake pedal may vibrate or motor operating noise may be heard from engine room. This is a normal status of operation check. Stopping distance may be longer than that of vehicles without ABS when vehicle drives on rough, gravel, or snow-covered (fresh, deep snow) roads. EBD  Electronic Brake Distribution is a function that detects subtle slippages between front and rear wheels during braking, and it improves handling stability by electronically controlling Brake Fluid Pressure which results in reduced rear wheel slippage. In case of electrical system break down, the fail-safe function is activated, EBD and ABS becomes inoperative, and ABS warning lamp and brake warning lamp are turned on. Electrical system diagnosis by CONSULT-II is available. During EBD operation, brake pedal lightly vibrates and a mechanical noise may be heard. This is normal.

SBR820BA BFS000DP Functions VDC K L In addition to the TCS/ABS function, the steering amount and brake operation amount are detected from the steering angle sensor and brake switch, and the driving condition (amount of under-steering/oversteering) is determined from information from the yaw rate/side/decel G sensor, vehicle speed sensor, etc. This information is used to improve vehicle stability by controlling the braking and engine power to all four wheels. The SLIP indicator lamp flashes to inform the driver of VDC operation. During VDC operation, the body and brake pedal lightly vibrate and mechanical noises may be heard. This is normal. ABS warning lamp, VDC OFF indicator lamp, and SLIP indicator lamp might turn on when the vehicle is subject to strong shaking or large vibration, such as when the vehicle is on a turn table or a ship while engine is running. In this case, restart engine on a normal road, and if ABS warning lamp, VDC OFF indicator lamp, and SLIP indicator lamp turn off, there is no malfunction. TCS  Speed signals for 4 wheels control engine output and transaxle conditions so that slip rate of the drive wheels is optimum. ABS actuator and electric unit (control unit) detects wheelspin. Output from the control unit controls brake fluid pressure to both LH and RH drive wheels while cutting fuel to the engine and closing the throttle valve to reduce engine torque when wheelspin is detected. Throttle position is continuously controlled to ensure the appropriate engine torque at all times. Depending on road conditions, the driver may have a sluggish feel. This is normal, because the optimum traction has the highest priority by TCS operation. TCS may be activated momentarily the vehicle suddenly accelerates, suddenly downshifts, or is driven on a road with a varying surface friction coefficient. During TCS operation, it informs a driver of system operation by flashing SLIP indicator lamp. SFIA2092E CAN Communication BFS000G2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION J K L CAN (Controller Area Network) is a serial communication line for real time application. It is an on-vehicle multiplex communication line with high data communication speed and excellent error detection ability. Many electronic control units are equipped on a vehicle, and each control unit shares information and links with other control units during operation (not independent). In CAN communication, control units are connected with 2 communication lines (CAN H line, CAN L line) allowing a high rate of information transmission with less wiring. Each control unit transmits/receives data but selectively reads required data only.Refer to LAN-49, CAN System Specification Chart .

FEEDBACK CONTROL When controlling the normal fluid pressure or the selected fluid pressure, the secondary pressure can be set more accurately by using the fluid pressure sensor to detect the secondary pressure and controlling the feed- back. Shift Control In order to select the gear ratio which can obtain the driving force in accordance with driver s intention and the vehicle condition, TCM monitors the driving conditions, such as the vehicle speed and the throttle position and selects the optimum gear ratio, and determines the gear change steps to the gear ratio. Then send the com- mand to the step motor, and control the flow-in/flow-out of line pressure from the primary pulley to determine the position of the moving-pulley and control the gear ratio. BCS001G6 Line Pressure and Secondary Pressure Control When an input torque signal equivalent to the engine drive force is sent from the ECM to the TCM, the TCM controls the line pressure solenoid valve and secondary pressure solenoid valve.   This line pressure solenoid controls the pressure regulator valve as the signal pressure and adjusts the pressure of the operating oil discharged from the oil pump to the line pressure most appropriate to the driving state. Secondary pressure is controlled by decreasing line pressure.  M POSITION When the selector lever is put in the manual shift gate side, the fixed changing gear line is set.

ACCELERATION CONTROL K According to vehicle speed and a change of accelerator pedal angle, driver s request for acceleration and driving scene are judged. This function assists improvement in acceleration feeling by making the engine speed proportionate to the vehicle speed. And a shift map which can gain a larger driving force is available for compatibility of mileage with drivability. Lock-up and Select Control BCS001G7 The torque converter clutch piston in the torque converter is engaged to eliminate torque converter slip to increase power transmission efficiency.   M The torque converter clutch control valve operation is controlled by the torque converter clutch solenoid valve, which is controlled by a signal from TCM. The torque converter clutch control valve engages or releases the torque converter clutch piston. When shifting between N ( P ) D ( R ), torque converter clutch solenoid controls engagement power of forward clutch and reverse brake. The lock-up applied gear range was expanded by locking up the torque converter at a lower vehicle speed than conventional CVT models.  D POSITION Shifting over all the ranges of gear ratios from the lowest to the highest. SCIA4582E"
"3 TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH AND SELECT CONTROL VALVE CONTROL  Lock-up and Select Control System Diagram It is much more difficult to diagnose an error that occurs intermittently rather than continuously. Most intermittent errors are caused by poor electric connections or improper wiring. In this case, careful checking of suspected circuits may help prevent the replacement of good parts. A visual check only may not find the cause of the errors. A road test with CONSULT-II or a circuit tester connected should be performed. Follow the CVT-26, WORK FLOW . Before undertaking actual checks, take a few minutes to talk with a customer who approaches with a driveability complaint. The customer can supply good information about such errors, especially intermittent ones. Find out what symptoms are present and under what conditions they occur. A DIAGNOSTIC WORKSHEET as shown on the example (Refer to CVT-27) should be used. Start your diagnosis by looking for conventional errors first. This will help troubleshoot driveability errors on an electronically controlled engine vehicle. Also check related Service bulletins. WORK FLOW A good understanding of the malfunction conditions can make troubleshooting faster and more accurate. In general, each customer feels differently about a malfunction. It is important to fully understand the symptoms or conditions for a customer complaint. Make good use of the two sheets provided, CVT-27, Information from Customer and CVT-27, Diagnostic Worksheet Chart , to perform the best troubleshooting possible.

"1 BKS001RX UNIFIED METER AND A/C AMP. Refer to DI-27, System Description in UNIFIED METER AND A/C AMP . COMBINATION METERS System Description UNIFIED METER CONTROL UNIT Speedometer, odo/trip meter, tachometer and fuel gauge are controlled by the unified meter control unit, which is built into the combination meter. Unified meter control unit receives signals from unified meter and A/C amp.   Warning lamp and indicator lamp of combination meter are controlled by signals drawn from the unified meter and A/C amp. Digital meter is adopted for odo/trip meter*. *The record of the odo meter is kept even if the battery cable is disconnected. The record of the trip meter is erased when the battery cable is disconnected. Odo/trip meter and shift indicator segments can be checked in diagnosis mode.  Meters/gauges can be checked in diagnosis mode. Illumination control  Unified meter control unit produces an illumination output of the combination meter when the ignition switch is ON .   Light levels can be adjusted by pressing illumination control switch of the combination meter when lighting switch is ON . Illumination control switch has five light level settings. NOTE: When it is light outside, light level cannot be adjusted by turning on the lighting switch. HOW TO CHANGE THE DISPLAY FOR ODO/TRIP METER The vehicle speed signal and the memory signals from the meter memory circuit are processed by the combination meter and the mileage is displayed.    Depressing the odo/trip meter switch toggles the mode in the following order. SEL175W The odo/trip meter display mode toggling and trip display resetting can be identified by the amount of time that elapses from pressing the odo/trip meter switch to releasing it. When resetting with trip A displayed, only trip A display is reset (The same way for trip B ).   POWER SUPPLY AND GROUND CIRCUIT Power is supplied at all times  through 10A fuse [No. 19, located in the fuse block (J/B)] to unified meter and A/C amp. terminal 21, through 15A fuse [No. 17, located in the fuse block (J/B)]    to combination meter terminal 7.

"1 Always use a 12 volt battery as power source. Do not attempt to disconnect battery cables while engine is running. Before connecting or disconnecting the ECM harness connector, turn ignition switch OFF and disconnect negative battery cable. Failure to do so may damage the ECM because battery voltage is applied to ECM even if ignition switch is turned OFF. Before removing parts, turn ignition switch OFF and then disconnect negative battery cable. PRECAUTIONS Precautions for Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER BBS005B9 The Supplemental Restraint System such as AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER , used along with a front seat belt, helps to reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger for certain types of collision. Information necessary to service the system safely is included in the SRS and SB section of this Service Manual. WARNING: To avoid rendering the SRS inoperative, which could increase the risk of personal injury or death in the event of a collision which would result in air bag inflation, all maintenance must be performed by an authorized NISSAN/INFINITI dealer.   Improper maintenance, including incorrect removal and installation of the SRS, can lead to personal injury caused by unintentional activation of the system. For removal of Spiral Cable and Air Bag Module, see the SRS section. Do not use electrical test equipment on any circuit related to the SRS unless instructed to in this Service Manual. SRS wiring harnesses can be identified by yellow and/or orange harnesses or harness connectors. BBS005BA The ECM has an on board diagnostic system. It will light up the malfunction indicator (MI) to warn the driver of a malfunction causing emission deterioration. CAUTION: Be sure to turn the ignition switch OFF and disconnect the negative battery cable before any repair or inspection work. The open/short circuit of related switches, sensors, solenoid valves, etc. will cause the MI to light up.   Be sure to connect and lock the connectors securely after work. A loose (unlocked) connector will cause the MI to light up due to the open circuit. (Be sure the connector is free from water, grease, dirt, bent terminals, etc.) Certain systems and components, especially those related to OBD, may use a new style slidelocking type harness connector. For description and how to disconnect, refer to PG-71, HAR-NESS CONNECTOR . Be sure to route and secure the harnesses properly after work. The interference of the harness with a bracket, etc. may cause the MI to light up due to the short circuit. Be sure to erase the unnecessary malfunction information (repairs completed) from the ECM before returning the vehicle to the customer. BBS005BB SEF289H Do not disassemble ECM. If a battery cable is disconnected, the memory will return to the ECM value. The ECM will now start to self-control at its initial value. Engine operation can vary slightly when the terminal is disconnected. However, this is not an indication of a malfunction. Do not replace parts because of a slight variation. If the battery is disconnected, the following emissionrelated diagnostic information will be lost within 24 hours. -Diagnostic trouble codes -1st trip diagnostic trouble codes -Freeze frame data -1st trip freeze frame data When connecting ECM harness connector, fasten it securely with levers as far as they will go as shown in the figure.   PBIB1164E When connecting or disconnecting pin connectors into or from ECM, take care not to damage pin terminals (bend or break). Make sure that there are not any bends or breaks on ECM pin terminal, when connecting pin connectors. Securely connect ECM harness connectors. A poor connection can cause an extremely high (surge) voltage to develop in coil and condenser, thus resulting in damage to ICs. Keep engine control system harness at least 10 cm (4 in) away from adjacent harness, to prevent engine control system malfunctions due to receiving external noise, degraded operation of ICs, etc. Keep engine control system parts and harness dry. Before replacing ECM, perform ECM Terminals and Reference Value inspection and make sure ECM functions properly. Refer to EC-415, ECM Terminals and Reference Value  .  Handle mass air flow sensor carefully to avoid damage. Do not disassemble mass air flow sensor.   Do not clean mass air flow sensor with any type of detergent.  Do not disassemble electric throttle control actuator. Even a slight leak in the air intake system can cause serious incidents. MEF040D Do not shock or jar the camshaft position sensor (PHASE), crankshaft position sensor (POS). PBIB2466E PBIB0090E After performing each TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS, perform DTC Confirmation Procedure or Overall Function Check. The DTC should not be displayed in the DTC Confirmation Procedure if the repair is completed. The Overall Function Check should be a good result if the repair is completed. SEF348N SAT652J When measuring ECM signals with a circuit tester, never allow the two tester probes to contact. Accidental contact of probes will cause a short circuit and damage the ECM power transistor. Do not use ECM ground terminals when measuring input/ output voltage. Doing so may result in damage to the ECM s transistor. Use a ground other than ECM terminals, such as the ground. PBIB2259E Do not depress accelerator pedal when starting. Immediately after starting, do not rev up engine unnecessarily. Do not rev up engine just prior to shutdown."
"2 SEF709Y  When installing C.B. ham radio or a mobile phone, be sure to observe the following as it may adversely affect electronic control systems depending on installation location.-Keep the antenna as far as possible from the electronic control units. -Keep the antenna feeder line more than 20 cm (8 in) away from the harness of electronic controls. Do not let them run parallel for a long distance. -Adjust the antenna and feeder line so that the standingwave radio can be kept smaller. -Be sure to ground the radio to vehicle body. ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM System Diagram The mixture ratio feedback system provides the best air-fuel mixture ratio for driveability and emission control. The three way catalyst (manifold) can then better reduce CO, HC and NOx emissions. This system uses heated oxygen sensor 1 in the exhaust manifold to monitor whether the engine operation is rich or lean. The ECM adjusts the injection pulse width according to the sensor voltage signal. For more information about heated oxygen sensor 1, refer to EC-143. This maintains the mixture ratio within the range of stoichiometric (ideal air-fuel mixture). This stage is referred to as the closed loop control condition. Heated oxygen sensor 2 is located downstream of the three way catalyst (manifold). Even if the switching characteristics of heated oxygen sensor 1 shift, the air-fuel ratio is controlled to stoichiometric by the signal from heated oxygen sensor 2. Fuel is injected into each cylinder during each engine cycle according to the firing order. This system is used when the engine is running. FUEL INJECTION TIMING PBIB0491E H I J The evaporative emission system is used to reduce hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere from the fuel system. This reduction of hydrocarbons is accomplished by activated charcoals in the EVAP canister. The fuel vapor in the sealed fuel tank is led into the EVAP canister which contains activated carbon and the vapor is stored there when the engine is not operating or when refueling to the fuel tank. The vapor in the EVAP canister is purged by the air through the purge line to the intake manifold when the engine is operating. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is controlled by ECM. When the engine operates, the flow rate of vapor controlled by EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is proportionally regulated as the air flow increases. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve also shuts off the vapor purge line during decelerating and idling. Pressure: 15.3-20.0 kPa (0.153-0.200 bar, 0.156-0.204 kg/cm$^{2}$, 2.22-2.90 psi) Vacuum:-6.0 to-3.4 kPa (-0.060 to-0.034 bar,-0.061 to-0.035 kg/cm$^{2}$,-0.87 to-0.49 psi) 1. Block port B. 2. Blow air into port A and check that it flows freely out of port C. 3. Release blocked port B. 4. Apply vacuum pressure to port B and check that vacuum pressure exists at the ports A and C. 5. Block port A and B. 6. Apply pressure to port C and check that there is no leakage. PBIB1588E BBS005BN PBIB0492E S-ET277 BBS005BO When replacing ECM, initialization of NATS system and registration of all NATS ignition key IDs must be carried out with CONSULT-II using NATS program card. Therefore, be sure to receive all keys from vehicle owner. SEF543X Regarding the procedures of NATS initialization and all NATS ignition key ID registration, refer to CONSULT-II Operation Manual, NATS."
"3 FREEZE FRAME DATA AND 1ST TRIP FREEZE FRAME DATA M The ECM records the driving conditions such as fuel system status, calculated load value, engine coolant temperature, short term fuel trim, long term fuel trim, engine speed, vehicle speed, base fuel schedule and intake air temperature at the moment a malfunction is detected. Data which are stored in the ECM memory, along with the 1st trip DTC, are called 1st trip freeze frame data. The data, stored together with the DTC data, are called freeze frame data and displayed on CONSULT-II. Only one set of freeze frame data (either 1st trip freeze frame data or freeze frame data) can be stored in the ECM. 1st trip freeze frame data is stored in the ECM memory along with the 1st trip DTC. There is no priority for 1st trip freeze frame data and it is updated each time a different 1st trip DTC is detected. However, once freeze frame data (2nd trip detection/MI ON) is stored in the ECM memory, 1st trip freeze frame data is no longer stored. Remember, only one set of freeze frame data can be stored in the ECM. Both 1st trip freeze frame data and freeze frame data (along with the DTCs) are cleared when the ECM memory is erased. Procedures for clearing the ECM memory are described in EC-35, HOW TO ERASE EMIS- SION-RELATED DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION . HOW TO ERASE EMISSION-RELATED DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION How to Erase DTC  WITH CONSULT-II The emission related diagnostic information in the ECM can be erased by selecting ERASE in the SELF-DIAG RESULTS mode with CONSULT-II. PBIB0911E PBIB2496E  Without CONSULT-II 1. If the ignition switch stays ON after repair work, be sure to turn ignition switch OFF once. 2. Wait at least 10 seconds and then turn it ON (engine stopped) again. 3. Change the diagnostic test mode from Mode II to Mode I by depressing the accelerator pedal. If the battery is disconnected, the emission-related diagnostic information will be lost within 24 hours.   The following data are cleared when the ECM memory is erased.   -Diagnostic trouble codes -1st trip diagnostic trouble codes -Freeze frame data -1st trip freeze frame data Actual work procedures are explained using a DTC as an example. Be careful so that not only the DTC, but all of the data listed above, are cleared from the ECM memory during work procedures. Malfunction Indicator (MI) DESCRIPTION BBS005BS The MI is located on the instrument panel. 1. The MI will light up when the ignition switch is turned ON without the engine running. This is a bulb check. If the MI does not light up, refer to DI-35, WARNING LAMPS or see EC-344, MI & DATA LINK CONNECTORS . 2. When the engine is started, the MI should go off. If the MI remains on, the on board diagnostic system has detected an engine system malfunction. 1. If the ignition switch stays ON after repair work, be sure to turn ignition switch OFF once. Wait at least 10 seconds and then turn it ON (engine stopped) again. 2. Touch ENGINE . 3. Touch SELF-DIAG RESULTS . 4. Touch ERASE . (The DTC in the ECM will be erased.) Always ECM returns to Diagnostic Test Mode I after ignition switch is turned OFF. How to Set Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-Diagnostic Results) 1. Confirm that accelerator pedal is fully released, turn ignition switch ON and wait 3 seconds. 2. Repeat the following procedure quickly five times within 5 seconds. a. Fully depress the accelerator pedal. b. Fully release the accelerator pedal. 3. Wait 7 seconds, fully depress the accelerator pedal and keep it for approx. 10 seconds until the MI starts blinking. 4.

These DTC numbers are clarified in Diagnostic Test Mode II (SELF-DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS)   DIAGNOSTIC TEST MODE II-SELF-DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS In this mode, the DTC and 1st trip DTC are indicated by the number of blinks of the MI as shown below. The DTC and 1st trip DTC are displayed at the same time. If the MI does not illuminate in diagnostic test mode I (Malfunction warning), all displayed items are 1st trip DTCs. If only one code is displayed when the MI illuminates in diagnostic test mode II (SELF-DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS), it is a DTC; if two or more codes are dis- PBIB0092E How to Set Diagnostic Test Mode II (Heated Oxygen Sensor 1 Monitor) 1. Set the ECM in Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-diagnostic results). Refer to EC-38, How to Set Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-Diagnostic Results) . 2. Start Engine. ECM has entered to Diagnostic Test Mode II (Heated oxygen sensor 1 monitor). How to Erase Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-Diagnostic Results) 1. Set ECM in Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-diagnostic results). Refer to EC-38, How to Set Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-Diagnostic Results) . 2. Fully depress the accelerator pedal and keep it for more than 10 seconds. The emission-related diagnostic information has been erased from the backup memory in the ECM. 3. Fully release the accelerator pedal, and confirm the DTC 0000 is displayed. DIAGNOSTIC TEST MODE I-BULB CHECK In this mode, the MI on the instrument panel should stay ON. If it remains OFF, check the bulb. Refer to DI-35, WARNING LAMPS or see EC-344, MI & DATA LINK CONNECTORS . DIAGNOSTIC TEST MODE I-MALFUNCTION WARNING played, they may be either DTCs or 1st trip DTCs. DTC No. is same as that of 1st trip DTC. These unidentified codes can be identified by using the CONSULT-II. A DTC will be used as an example for how to read a code. *: Maintains conditions just before switching to open loop. To check the heated oxygen sensor 1 function, start engine in the Diagnostic Test Mode II and warm it up until engine coolant temperature indicator points to the middle of the gauge. Next run engine at about 2,000 rpm for about 2 minutes under no-load conditions. Then make sure that the MI comes ON more than 5 times within 10 seconds with engine running at 2,000 rpm under no-load. PBIA3905E A particular trouble code can be identified by the number of four-digit numeral flashes. The zero is indicated by the number of ten flashes. The length of time the 1,000th-digit numeral flashes on and off is 1.2 seconds consisting of an ON (0.6-second)-OFF (0.6-second) cycle. The 100th-digit numeral and lower digit numerals consist of a 0.3-second ON and 0.3-second OFF cycle. A change from one digit numeral to another occurs at an interval of 1.0-second OFF. In other words, the later numeral appears on the display 1.3 seconds after the former numeral has disappeared. A change from one trouble code to another occurs at an interval of 1.8-second OFF. In this way, all the detected malfunctions are classified by their DTC numbers. The DTC 0000 refers to no malfunction. (See EC-10, INDEX FOR DTC ) How to Erase Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-Diagnostic Results) The DTC can be erased from the back up memory in the ECM by depressing accelerator pedal. Refer to EC-37, HOW TO SWITCH DIAGNOSTIC TEST MODE . If the battery is disconnected, the DTC will be lost from the backup memory within 24 hours. Be careful not to erase the stored memory before starting trouble diagnoses.

After engine stalls, crank it two or three times to release all fuel pressure. FUEL PRESSURE CHECK Before disconnecting fuel line, release fuel pressure from fuel line to eliminate danger. NOTE: Prepare pans or saucers under the disconnected fuel line because the fuel may spill out. The fuel pressure cannot be completely released because J31 models do not have fuel return system. CAUTION: The fuel hose connection method used when taking fuel pressure check must not be used for other purposes. Be careful not to scratch or put debris around connection area when servicing, so that the quick connector maintains sealability with O-rings inside.  When installing fuel hose quick connector, refer to EM-19, INTAKE MANIFOLD . 1. Release fuel pressure to zero. Refer to EC-49, FUEL PRESSURE RELEASE . 2. Prepare fuel hose and fuel hose clamp for fuel pressure check, and connect fuel pressure gauge. Use suitable fuel hose for fuel pressure check (genuine NISSAN fuel hose without quick connector). To avoid unnecessary force or tension to hose, use moderately long fuel hose for fuel pressure check. Do not use the fuel hose for checking fuel pressure with damage or cracks on it.        Use Pressure Gauge to check fuel pressure. 3. Remove fuel hose. Refer to EM-19, INTAKE MANIFOLD . Do not twist or kink fuel hose because it is plastic hose.   Do not remove fuel hose from quick connector.   Keep the original fuel hose to be free from intrusion of dust or foreign substances with a suitable cover.   in).

PBIB1870E *: This signal is sent to the ECM through CAN communication line. PBIB1842E BBS005CQ PBIB3278E This mechanism hydraulically controls cam phases continuously with the fixed operating angle of the intake valve. The ECM receives signals such as crankshaft position, camshaft position, engine speed, and engine coolant temperature. Then, the ECM sends ON/OFF pulse duty signals to the intake valve timing control solenoid valve depending on driving status. This makes it possible to control the shut/open timing of the intake valve to increase engine torque in low/mid speed range and output in high-speed range. COMPONENT DISCRIPTION Intake valve timing control solenoid valve is activated by ON/OFF pulse duty (ratio) signals from the ECM. The intake valve timing control solenoid valve changes the oil amount and direction of flow through intake valve timing control unit or stops oil flow. The longer pulse width advances valve angle. The shorter pulse width retards valve angle. When ON and OFF pulse widths become equal, the solenoid valve stops oil pressure flow to fix the intake valve angle at the control position. BBS005CP 7.

PBIB0103E The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve uses a ON/ OFF duty to control the flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister. The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is moved by ON/OFF pulses from the ECM. The longer the ON pulse, the greater the amount of fuel vapor that will flow through the valve. *1: ECM determines the start signal status by the signals of engine speed and battery voltage. *2: This signal is sent to the ECM through CAN communication line. This system controls flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister. The opening of the vapor by-pass passage in the EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve changes to control the flow rate. The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve repeats ON/OFF operation according to the signal sent from the ECM. The opening of the valve varies for optimum engine control. The optimum value stored in the ECM is determined by considering various engine conditions. When the engine is operating, the flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister is regulated as the air flow changes. SEF337U BBS005IB BBS005IC PBIB0569E PBIB2124E 5.

BBS005IE PBIB0150E BBS005IF PBIB0149E Check air passage continuity of EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve under the following conditions. The fuel injector is a small, precise solenoid valve. When the ECM supplies a ground to the fuel injector circuit, the coil in the fuel injector is energized. The energized coil pulls the ball valve back and allows fuel to flow through the fuel injector into the intake manifold. The amount of fuel injected depends upon the injection pulse duration. Pulse duration is the length of time the fuel injector remains open. The ECM controls the injection pulse duration based on engine fuel needs. BBS005IG SEF375Z BBS005IH BBS005II PBIB1986E 1.

D E The ECM activates the fuel pump for several seconds after the ignition switch is turned ON to improve engine startability. If the ECM receives a engine speed signal from the crankshaft position sensor (POS) and camshaft position sensor (PHASE), it knows that the engine is rotating, and causes the pump to operate. If the engine speed signal is not received when the ignition switch is ON, the engine stalls. The ECM stops pump operation and prevents battery discharging, thereby improving safety. The ECM does not directly drive the fuel pump. It controls the ON/OFF fuel pump relay, which in turn controls the fuel pump. PBIB2259E BBS005IN FUEL PUMP BBS005IO 1. Turn ignition switch ON. 2.

"41 Always use a 12 volt battery as power source. Do not attempt to disconnect battery cables while engine is running. Before connecting or disconnecting the ECM harness connector, turn ignition switch OFF and disconnect negative battery cable. Failure to do so may damage the ECM because battery voltage is applied to ECM even if ignition switch is turned OFF. Before removing parts, turn ignition switch OFF and then disconnect negative battery cable. PRECAUTIONS PFP:00001 Precautions for Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER BBS004XC C EC The Supplemental Restraint System such as AIR BAG and SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER , used alon with a front seat belt, helps to reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger for certain types of collision. Information necessary to service the system safely is included in the SRS and SB section of this Service Manual. g WARNING: D To avoid rendering the SRS inoperative, which could increase the risk of personal injury or death in the event of a collision which would result in air bag inflation, all maintenance must be performed by an authorized NISSAN/INFINITI dealer. E Improper maintenance, including incorrect removal and installation of the SRS, can lead to personal injury caused by unintentional activation of the system. For removal of Spiral Cable and Air Bag Module, see the SRS section. Do not use electrical test equipment on any circuit related to the SRS unless instructed to in this Service Manual. SRS wiring harnesses can be identified by yellow and/or orange harnesses or harness connectors. BBS004XD G The ECM has an on board diagnostic system. It will light up the malfunction indicator (MI) to warn the driver of a malfunction causing emission deterioration. CAUTION: H Be sure to turn the ignition switch OFF and disconnect the negative battery cable before any repair or inspection work. The open/short circuit of related switches, sensors, solenoid valves, etc. will cause the MI to light up. I Be sure to connect and lock the connectors securely after work. A loose (unlocked) connector will cause the MI to light up due to the open circuit. (Be sure the connector is free from water, grease, dirt, bent terminals, etc.) J Certain systems and components, especially those related to OBD, may use a new style slidelocking type harness connector. For description and how to disconnect, refer to PG-71, HAR-NESS CONNECTOR . Be sure to route and secure the harnesses properly after work. The interference of the harness with a bracket, etc. may cause the MI to light up due to the short circuit. Be sure to erase the unnecessary malfunction information (repairs completed) from the ECM before returning the vehicle to the customer. BBS004XE SEF289H  Do not disassemble ECM. If a battery cable is disconnected, the memory will return to the ECM value.   The ECM will now start to self-control at its initial value. Engine operation can vary slightly when the terminal is disconnected. However, this is not an indication of a malfunction. Do not replace parts because of a slight variation. If the battery is disconnected, the following emissionrelated diagnostic information will be lost within 24 hours. -Diagnostic trouble codes -1st trip diagnostic trouble codes -Freeze frame data -1st trip freeze frame data When connecting ECM harness connector, fasten it securely with levers as far as they will go as shown in the figure. PBIB2466E PBIB1164E PBIB0090E When connecting or disconnecting pin connectors into or from ECM, take care not to damage pin terminals (bend or break). Make sure that there are not any bends or breaks on ECM pin terminal, when connecting pin connectors. Securely connect ECM harness connectors. A poor connection can cause an extremely high (surge) voltage to develop in coil and condenser, thus resulting in damage to ICs. Keep engine control system harness at least 10 cm (4 in) away from adjacent harness, to prevent engine control system malfunctions due to receiving external noise, degraded operation of ICs, etc. Keep engine control system parts and harness dry. Before replacing ECM, perform ECM Terminals and Reference Value inspection and make sure ECM functions properly. Refer to EC-415, ECM Terminals and Reference Value  .  Handle mass air flow sensor carefully to avoid damage. Do not disassemble mass air flow sensor.   Do not clean mass air flow sensor with any type of detergent.   Do not disassemble electric throttle control actuator. Even a slight leak in the air intake system can cause serious incidents. MEF040D Do not shock or jar the camshaft position sensor (PHASE), crankshaft position sensor (POS). When measuring ECM signals with a circuit tester, never allow the two tester probes to contact. Accidental contact of probes will cause a short circuit and damage the ECM power transistor. Do not use ECM ground terminals when measuring input/ output voltage. Doing so may result in damage to the ECM s transistor. Use a ground other than ECM terminals, such as the ground. SEC893C Do not depress accelerator pedal when starting. Immediately after starting, do not rev up engine unnecessarily. Do not rev up engine just prior to shutdown. SEF708Y SEF709Y When installing C.B. ham radio or a mobile phone, be sure to observe the following as it may adversely affect electronic control systems depending on installation location. -Keep the antenna as far as possible from the electronic control units. -Keep the antenna feeder line more than 20 cm (8 in) away from the harness of electronic controls. Do not let them run parallel for a long distance. -Adjust the antenna and feeder line so that the standingwave radio can be kept smaller. -Be sure to ground the radio to vehicle body."
"42 E F The mixture ratio feedback system provides the best air-fuel mixture ratio for driveability and emission control. The three way catalyst (manifold) can then better reduce CO, HC and NOx emissions. This system uses heated oxygen sensor 1 in the exhaust manifold to monitor whether the engine operation is rich or lean. The ECM adjusts the injection pulse width according to the sensor voltage signal. For more information about heated oxygen sensor 1, refer to EC-486, DTC P0132, P0152 HO2S1 . This maintains the mixture ratio within the range of stoichiometric (ideal air-fuel mixture). This stage is referred to as the closed loop control condition. G Heated oxygen sensor 2 is located downstream of the three way catalyst (manifold). Even if the switching characteristics of heated oxygen sensor 1 shift, the air-fuel ratio is controlled to stoichiometric by the signal from heated oxygen sensor 2. Fuel is injected into each cylinder during each engine cycle according to the firing order. This system is used when the engine is running. Two types of systems are used. PBIB0491E The evaporative emission system is used to reduce hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere from the fuel system. This reduction of hydrocarbons is accomplished by activated charcoals in the EVAP canister. The fuel vapor in the sealed fuel tank is led into the EVAP canister which contains activated carbon and the vapor is stored there when the engine is not operating or when refueling to the fuel tank. The vapor in the EVAP canister is purged by the air through the purge line to the intake manifold when the engine is operating. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is controlled by ECM. When the engine operates, the flow rate of vapor controlled by EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is proportionally regulated as the air flow increases. EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve also shuts off the vapor purge line during decelerating. 1. Block port B and blow air through port A. Check that air flows freely through port C. 2. Block port A and blow air through port B. Check that air flows freely through port C.

Therefore, be sure to receive all keys from vehicle owner. Regarding the procedures of NATS initialization and all NATS ignition key ID registration, refer to CONSULT-II Operation Manual, NATS. SEF543X *2: In Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-diagnostic results) *3: The trouble shooting for this DTC needs CONSULT-II. DTC AND 1ST TRIP DTC The 1st trip DTC (whose number is the same as the DTC number) is displayed for the latest self-diagnostic result obtained. If the ECM memory was cleared previously, and the 1st trip DTC did not reoccur, the 1st trip DTC will not be displayed. E F If a malfunction is detected during the 1st trip, the 1st trip DTC is stored in the ECM memory. The MI will not light up (two trip detection logic). If the same malfunction is not detected in the 2nd trip (meeting the required driving pattern), the 1st trip DTC is cleared from the ECM memory. If the same malfunction is detected in the 2nd trip, both the 1st trip DTC and DTC are stored in the ECM memory and the MI lights up. In other words, the DTC is stored in the ECM memory and the MI lights up when the same malfunction occurs in two consecutive trips. If a 1st trip DTC is stored and a non-diagnostic operation is performed between the 1st and 2nd trips, only the 1st trip DTC will continue to be stored. For fail-safe items, the DTC is stored in the ECM memory even in the 1st trip. Procedures for clearing the DTC and the 1st trip DTC from the ECM memory are described in EC-376, HOW TO ERASE EMISSION-RELATED DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION . H When a 1st trip DTC is detected, check, print out or write down and erase (1st trip) DTC and Freeze Frame data as specified in Work Flow procedure Step 2, refer to EC-395, WORK FLOW . Then perform DTC Confirmation Procedure or Overall Function Check to try to duplicate the malfunction. If the malfunction is duplicated, the item requires repair. How to Read DTC and 1st Trip DTC DTC and 1st trip DTC can be read by the following methods. With CONSULT-II CONSULT-II displays the DTC in SELF-DIAG RESULTS mode. Examples: P0117, P0340, P1065, etc. (CONSULT-II also displays the malfunctioning component or system.) Without CONSULT-II The number of blinks of the MI in the Diagnostic Test Mode II (Self-Diagnostic Results) indicates the DTC. Example: 0117, 0340, 1065, etc. 1st trip DTC No. is the same as DTC No. L Output of a DTC indicates a malfunction. However, the Diagnostic Test Mode II does not indicate whether the malfunction is still occurring or has occurred in the past and has returned to normal. CONSULT-II can identify malfunction status as shown below. Therefore, using CONSULT-II (if available) is recommended. M A sample of CONSULT-II display for DTC and 1st trip DTC is shown below. DTC or 1st trip DTC of a malfunction is displayed in SELF-DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS mode of CONSULT-II. Time data indicates how many times the vehicle was driven after the last detection of a DTC. If the DTC is being detected currently, the time data will be [0]. If a 1st trip DTC is stored in the ECM, the time data will be [1t]. FREEZE FRAME DATA AND 1ST TRIP FREEZE FRAME DATA The ECM records the driving conditions such as fuel system status, engine coolant temperature, short term fuel trim, long term fuel trim, engine speed, vehicle speed, base fuel schedule and intake air temperature at the moment a malfunction is detected. Data which are stored in the ECM memory, along with the 1st trip DTC, are called 1st trip freeze frame data. The data, stored together with the DTC data, are called freeze frame data and displayed on CONSULT-II. For details, see EC-427, Freeze Frame Data and 1st Trip Freeze Frame Data . Only one set of freeze frame data (either 1st trip freeze frame data or freeze frame data) can be stored in the ECM. 1st trip freeze frame data is stored in the ECM memory along with the 1st trip DTC. There is no priority for 1st trip freeze frame data and it is updated each time a different 1st trip DTC is detected. However, once freeze frame data (2nd trip detection/MI on) is stored in the ECM memory, 1st trip freeze frame data is no longer stored. Remember, only one set of freeze frame data can be stored in the ECM. Both 1st trip freeze frame data and freeze frame data (along with the DTCs) are cleared when the ECM memory is erased. Procedures for clearing the ECM memory are described in EC-376, HOW TO ERASE EMIS-SION-RELATED DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION . HOW TO ERASE EMISSION-RELATED DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION How to Erase DTC WITH CONSULT-II The emission related diagnostic information in the ECM can be erased by selecting ERASE in the SELF-DIAG RESULTS mode with CONSULT-II. 1. If the ignition switch stays ON after repair work, be sure to turn ignition switch OFF once. Wait at least 10 seconds and then turn it ON (engine stopped) again. 2. Turn CONSULT-II ON and touch ENGINE . 3. Touch SELF-DIAG RESULTS . 4. Touch ERASE . (The DTC in the ECM will be erased.)"
"43 When there is an open circuit on MI circuit, the ECM can not warn the driver by lighting up MI when there is trouble on engine control system. Therefore, when electrical controlled throttle and part of ECM related diagnoses is continuously detected as NG for 5 trips, ECM warns the driver that engine control system malfunctions and MI circuit is open by means of operating fail-safe function. The fail-safe function also operate when above diagnoses except MI circuit are detected and demands the driver to repair the trouble. Engine speed will not rise more than 2,500 rpm due to the fuel cut Engine operating condition in fail-safe mode 1st trip freeze frame data A Actual work procedures are explained using a DTC as an example. Be careful so that not only the DTC, but all of the data listed above, are cleared from the ECM memory during work procedures. Malfunction Indicator (MI) BBS005AX DESCRIPTION The MI is located on the instrument panel. 1. The MI will light up when the ignition switch is turned ON without the engine running. This is a bulb check. If the MI does not light up, refer to DI-35, WARNING LAMPS or see EC-763. 2. When the engine is started, the MI should go off. If the MI remains on, the on board diagnostic system has detected an engine system malfunction. MI Flashing without DTC If the ECM is in Diagnostic Test Mode II, MI may flash when engine is running. In this case, check ECM diagnostic test mode. Refer to EC-378, HOW TO SWITCH DIAGNOSTIC TEST MODE .

CHECK GROUND CONNECTIONS Loosen and retighten two ground screws on the body. Refer to EC-457, Ground Inspection . Ground Inspection  Ground connections are very important to the proper operation of electrical and electronic circuits. Ground connections are often exposed to moisture, dirt and other corrosive elements. The corrosion (rust) can become an unwanted resistance. This unwanted resistance can change the way a circuit works. Electronically controlled circuits are very sensitive to proper grounding. A loose or corroded ground can drastically affect an electronically controlled circuit. A poor or corroded ground can easily affect the circuit. Even when the ground connection looks clean, there can be a thin film of rust on the surface. When inspecting a ground connection follow these rules:  Remove the ground bolt or screw. Inspect all mating surfaces for tarnish, dirt, rust, etc. Clean as required to assure good contact. E Reinstall bolt or screw securely. Inspect for add-on accessories which may be interfering with the ground circuit. If several wires are crimped into one ground eyelet terminal, check for proper crimps. Make sure all of the wires are clean, securely fastened and providing a good ground path. If multiple wires are cased in one eyelet make sure no ground wires have excess wire insulation.       For detailed ground distribution information, refer to PG-29, Ground Distribution . PBIB1870E BBS004YU *: This signal is sent to the ECM through CAN communication line. PBIB1389E This mechanism hydraulically controls cam phases continuously with the fixed operating angle of the intake valve.

"74 The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve uses a ON/ OFF duty to control the flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister. The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve is moved by ON/OFF pulses from the ECM. The longer the ON pulse, the greater the amount of fuel vapor that will flow through the valve. *2: This signal is sent to the ECM through CAN communication line. G H This system controls flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister. The opening of the vapor by-pass passage in the EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve changes to control the flow rate. The EVAP canister purge volume control solenoid valve repeats ON/OFF operation according to the signal sent from the ECM. The opening of the valve varies for optimum engine control. The optimum value stored in the ECM is determined by considering various engine conditions. When the engine is operating, the flow rate of fuel vapor from the EVAP canister is regulated as the air flow changes. SPECIFICATION BBS0056D PBIB2124E  With CONSULT-II 1.

The ECM activates the fuel pump for 1 second after the ignition switch is turned ON to improve engine startability. If the ECM receives a engine speed signal from the camshaft position sensor (PHASE), it knows that the engine is rotating, and causes the pump to operate. If the engine speed signal is not received when the ignition switch is ON, the engine stalls. The ECM stops pump operation and prevents battery discharging, thereby improving safety. The ECM does not directly drive the fuel pump. It controls the ON/OFF fuel pump relay, which in turn controls the fuel pump. PBIB2259E BBS0056Q BBS0056R 1. Turn ignition switch ON. 2.

This signal introduces the intake manifold vacuum into the power valve actuator and therefore closes the power valve. L Under this condition, the effective intake manifold length is equivalent to the total length of passage A and passage B. This long intake manifold provides increased amount of intake air, which results in improved suction efficiency and higher torque. M When engine is running at low or high speed, the ECM sends the OFF signal to the VIAS control solenoid valve and the power valve is opened. Under this condition, the effective intake manifold length is equivalent to the length of passage B. This shortened intake manifold length results in enhanced engine output due to reduced suction resistance under high speeds.
